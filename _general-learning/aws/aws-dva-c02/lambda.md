Certainly! Let's explore **AWS Lambda** in detail.

---

### **Overview**

**AWS Lambda** is a serverless, event-driven computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. With Lambda, you write your code and upload it, and AWS handles the rest, including scaling, fault tolerance, and availability. You pay only for the compute time you consume—there's no charge when your code isn't running.
