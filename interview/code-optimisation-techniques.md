Here's an in-depth exploration of each of the points you mentioned, along with explanations, examples, and learning steps for mastering them:

---

### **1. Time Complexity Analysis**
- **Concept**: Time complexity measures the time an algorithm takes to complete relative to its input size. It is expressed using Big O notation, such as \( O(1) \), \( O(n) \), \( O(n^2) \), etc.

#### Learning Steps:
1. **Understand Big O Notation**:
   - Learn the rules of calculating time complexity.
   - Examples: Single loop (\( O(n) \)), nested loop (\( O(n^2) \)), recursion (\( O(2^n) \)).
2. **Identify Bottlenecks**:
   - Use profiling tools like Python’s `cProfile` to identify slow parts.
   - Break down the algorithm and analyze each step.
3. **Optimize Critical Sections**:
   - Replace nested loops with efficient algorithms (e.g., sort + binary search).
   - Use divide-and-conquer techniques for large datasets.
   
#### Example:
```python
# Example of reducing time complexity in finding duplicates
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2]

# O(n^2) naive approach
for i in range(len(nums)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] == nums[j]:
            print("Duplicate:", nums[i])

# Optimized O(n) approach using a set
seen = set()
for num in nums:
    if num in seen:
        print("Duplicate:", num)
    seen.add(num)
```

# In-place solution (O(1) space)
i, j = 0, len(arr) - 1
while i < j:
    arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
    i += 1
    j -= 1
```

  3. **Algorithm Substitution**: Replace brute-force approaches with optimized ones like divide-and-conquer, greedy algorithms, or dynamic programming.

- **Example**:
  ```python
  # Inefficient approach
  nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  squares = [n**2 for n in nums if n % 2 == 0]  # Loops over nums once

  # Optimized approach
  from itertools import compress
  is_even = [n % 2 == 0 for n in nums]
  squares = list(compress(nums, is_even))  # Uses filtering in one go
  ```
