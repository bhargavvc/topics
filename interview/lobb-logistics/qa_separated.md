## Question 2
**Python's data types?**  
Integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

## Answer 2
Common data types in Python include integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

---

## Question 3
**List vs. tuple?**  
Lists are mutable; tuples are immutable.

## Answer 3
Lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed, while tuples are immutable and cannot be altered after creation.

---

## Question 4
**Memory management?**  
Python uses automatic memory management with a garbage collector.

## Answer 4
Python handles memory management automatically using a built-in garbage collector.

---

## Question 5
**What is a decorator?**  
It modifies the behavior of a function or class.

## Answer 5
A decorator is a function that modifies the behavior of another function or class.

---

## Question 6
**Purpose of self?**  
Refers to the instance of the class.

## Answer 6
The `self` keyword refers to the instance of the class in Python.

---

## Question 7
**List comprehensions?**  
A concise way to create lists.

## Answer 7
List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists in Python.

---

## Question 8
**is vs. ==?**  
== checks value equality, is checks identity.

## Answer 8
The `==` operator checks for value equality, while the `is` operator checks for identity.

---

## Question 9
**Lambda function?**  
An anonymous function defined with lambda.

## Answer 9
A lambda function is an anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword.

---

## Question 10
**Purpose of with statement?**  
Manages resources like file streams.

## Answer 10
The `with` statement is used to manage resources, such as file streams, ensuring proper acquisition and release.

---

## Question 11
**del vs. remove?**  
del removes by index, remove by value.

## Answer 11
The `del` statement removes an item by index, while the `remove` method removes an item by value.

---

## Question 12
**map function?**  
Applies a function to all items in an iterable.

## Answer 12
The `map` function applies a specified function to all items in an iterable.

---

## Question 13
**Purpose of zip?**  
Aggregates multiple iterables into tuples.

## Answer 13
The `zip` function aggregates multiple iterables into tuples, pairing elements from each iterable.

---

## Question 14
**range() vs. xrange()?**  
In Python 2, xrange() is memory efficient; in Python 3, range() behaves like xrange().

## Answer 14
In Python 2, `xrange()` is more memory efficient than `range()`. In Python 3, `range()` behaves like `xrange()`.

---

## Question 15
**unittest module?**  
A unit testing framework.

## Answer 15
The `unittest` module is a built-in framework for unit testing in Python.

---

## Question 16
**Purpose of __init__()?**  
Initializes a new object.

## Answer 16
The `__init__` method is used to initialize a new object in a class.

---

## Question 17
**Deepcopy vs. shallow copy?**  
Deepcopy copies recursively, shallow copy does not.

## Answer 17
A deepcopy creates a new object and recursively copies all objects found in the original, while a shallow copy creates a new object but inserts references into it to the objects found in the original.

---

## Question 18
**Purpose of pass?**  
A placeholder statement.

## Answer 18
The `pass` statement is a placeholder that does nothing; it's used when a statement is syntactically required but no action is needed.

---

## Question 19
**What are microservices?**  
Microservices are a software development technique—a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA)—where applications are structured as a collection of loosely coupled services.

## Answer 19
Microservices are a software development technique that structures applications as a collection of loosely coupled services.

---

## Question 20
**How do microservices differ from monolithic architecture?**  
In monolithic architecture, an application is built as a single unified unit, while microservices break it into smaller, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.

## Answer 20
Microservices differ from monolithic architecture in that they break applications into smaller, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs, whereas monolithic architecture builds everything as a single unit.
