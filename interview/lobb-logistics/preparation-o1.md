Below is a **time-blocked preparation schedule** tailored to your constraints and the key points in the job description. The goal is to cover enough ground to speak confidently about **Python backend development**, **frameworks**, **best practices**, and **system design**—all while allowing for short breaks to avoid burnout. This schedule assumes you have:

1. **All of today** (until around 1 AM)  
2. **Tomorrow morning (6 AM – 8 AM)** while traveling  
3. **Interview at Saturday, 10 AM**

Feel free to adjust the times as needed, but try to follow the sequence to ensure you touch on all important areas.

- **Outcome:** Ability to speak about how you maintain code quality, enforce style, and automate testing in your Python projects.

---

### **Block 6: 4:00 PM – 6:00 PM**  
**Focus:** **System Design + Basic Microservices Concepts**

- **Topics to Cover:**
  - Basic system design: load balancers, caching, database scaling, horizontal vs. vertical scaling.
  - Microservices fundamentals: independent deployment, service discovery, API Gateway, orchestration (Kubernetes).
  - How Docker & Kubernetes fit in a typical pipeline.

- **Approach / Resources / Techniques:**
  - **Watch** 1–2 short “system design” videos summarizing monolith vs. microservices, concurrency, etc.
  - **Draw** a quick architecture diagram (on paper or whiteboard) for a typical microservice-based system:
    - Clients → API Gateway → Microservices → Databases  
    - Log and monitoring solutions (e.g., ELK, Prometheus/Grafana).

- **Outcome:** You’ll be able to demonstrate a mid-level understanding of service-oriented architecture and how Python apps fit into containerization/orchestration pipelines.

## **General Tips**

1. **Prioritize Sleep & Breaks:** Pushing beyond 1 AM can reduce clarity on interview day. Aim for at least some rest.
2. **Practice Verbal Explanation:** Be ready to **explain** your reasoning. Show *how* you solve problems and *why* you choose certain approaches.
3. **Use Simple Language First:** Convey your ideas simply before diving into deep jargon. This demonstrates clarity.
4. **Ask Clarifying Questions:** In the interview, if something isn’t clear, *ask*. This shows good communication skills.
5. **Highlight Relevant Projects/Experience:** If you’ve built or contributed to projects using Django/Flask/FastAPI, mention them.
