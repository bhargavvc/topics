## **1. Overview: Layers and Protocols**

Communication stack
+-----------------------------+
|      Application Layer      |
|   HTTP / HTTPS / TLS/SSL    |
+-----------------------------+
|      Transport Layer        |
|             TCP             |
+-----------------------------+
|      Internet Layer         |
|             IP              |
+-----------------------------+
|      Link Layer             |
|   Ethernet / Wi-Fi / etc.   |
+-----------------------------+


To comprehend TCP/IP and HTTP/HTTPS, it's essential to understand the **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model**, which divides network communication into seven layers. While the TCP/IP model simplifies this into four layers, understanding both models provides clarity.

### **a. OSI Model (Seven Layers):**
![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bhargavvc/topics/main/img/networking/ossi-model.png)
1. **Application Layer**: Interfaces directly with the user applications.
2. **Presentation Layer**: Translates data formats (e.g., encryption).
3. **Session Layer**: Manages sessions between applications.
4. **Transport Layer**: Ensures reliable data transfer.
5. **Network Layer**: Handles logical addressing and routing.
6. **Data Link Layer**: Manages physical addressing and error detection.
7. **Physical Layer**: Deals with the physical transmission of data.

### **b. TCP/IP Model (Four Layers):**
1. **Application Layer**: Combines OSI's Application, Presentation, and Session layers.
2. **Transport Layer**: Similar to OSI's Transport layer.
3. **Internet Layer**: Corresponds to OSI's Network layer.
4. **Link Layer**: Encompasses OSI's Data Link and Physical layers.

**Key Takeaway**: **TCP/IP** operates primarily within the **Transport**, **Internet**, and **Link** layers, while **HTTP/HTTPS** operates at the **Application** layer.

## **2. TCP/IP Protocol Suite Explained**

**TCP/IP** is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. It governs how data is packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received.

### **a. Internet Protocol (IP):**
- **Function**: Responsible for addressing and routing packets so they can travel across networks and reach the correct destination.
- **IP Addressing**: Each device has a unique IP address (e.g., IPv4: 192.168.1.1 or IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

### **b. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):**
- **Function**: Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications.
- **Features**:
  - **Connection-Oriented**: Establishes a connection before data transmission (three-way handshake).
  - **Flow Control**: Manages the rate of data transmission.
  - **Error Checking**: Ensures data integrity through checksums.

### **c. User Datagram Protocol (UDP):** *(For context)*
- **Function**: Offers a connectionless datagram service with minimal protocol mechanisms.
- **Use Cases**: Streaming, gaming, VoIP where speed is crucial and some data loss is acceptable.

## **3. HTTP vs. HTTPS Explained**

**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** and **HTTPS (HTTP Secure)** are application-layer protocols used for transmitting hypermedia documents(img,video, html). The primary difference is security.

### **a. HTTP:**
- **Function**: Facilitates the transfer of web pages and resources between clients (browsers) and servers.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Stateless**: Each request is independent; the server doesn’t retain session information.
  - **Unencrypted**: Data is sent in plaintext, making it vulnerable to interception.

### **b. HTTPS:**
- **Function**: Enhances HTTP by adding a layer of security using **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** or **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Encrypted**: Data is encrypted during transmission, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
  - **Authenticated**: Verifies the server's identity through digital certificates, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

## **4. In-Depth Example: Loading a Secure Webpage**

Let’s walk through a comprehensive example of accessing a secure webpage (`https://www.example.com`) to illustrate how **TCP/IP** and **HTTPS** interact.

### **Step 1: DNS Resolution**
1. **User Action**: You enter `https://www.example.com` in your browser.
2. **DNS Query**:
   - **Function**: Translates the domain name (`www.example.com`) into its corresponding IP address (e.g., `93.184.216.34`).
   - **Process**:
     - Browser checks its cache.
     - If not found, it queries a DNS resolver.
     - The resolver queries authoritative DNS servers to obtain the IP address.

### **Step 2: Establishing a TCP Connection**
1. **Initiation**:
   - **Purpose**: Establish a reliable connection between your device (client) and the web server.
2. **Three-Way Handshake**:
   - **SYN**: Client sends a TCP SYN (synchronize) packet to the server to request a connection.
   - **SYN-ACK**: Server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet.
   - **ACK**: Client sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet back to the server.
3. **Connection Established**: A reliable, bidirectional communication channel is now open.

### **Step 3: TLS Handshake (Establishing HTTPS)**
1. **Purpose**: Secure the communication channel between client and server.
2. **Process**:
   - **Client Hello**: Client sends a message specifying supported TLS versions, cipher suites, and a randomly generated number.
   - **Server Hello**: Server responds with chosen TLS version, cipher suite, and its own random number.
   - **Server Certificate**: Server sends its digital certificate (issued by a trusted Certificate Authority, e.g., VeriSign) containing its public key.
   - **Key Exchange**:
     - **Client verifies** the server’s certificate against trusted CAs.
     - **Client generates a pre-master secret**, encrypts it with the server’s public key, and sends it to the server.
     - **Server decrypts** the pre-master secret with its private key.
   - **Session Keys Generated**: Both client and server generate symmetric session keys from the pre-master secret.
   - **Secure Channel Established**: All subsequent data is encrypted using these session keys.

### **Step 4: HTTP Request Over TLS**
1. **Encrypted Request**:
   - **Client Action**: Sends an HTTP GET request for the webpage (`GET / HTTP/1.1`) over the established TLS connection.
   - **Encryption**: The request is encrypted using the session key.
2. **Server Response**:
   - **Processing**: Server processes the request and prepares the HTML content.
   - **Encrypted Response**: Sends the HTTP response (`HTTP/1.1 200 OK`) along with the requested content, encrypted with the session key.

### **Step 5: Data Transmission Over TCP/IP**
1. **Data Packetization**:
   - **TCP**: Breaks down the encrypted HTTP request and response into smaller data packets.
   - **IP**: Routes these packets across the internet to the destination IP address.
2. **Reliability**:
   - **Sequencing**: Ensures packets are reassembled in the correct order.
   - **Error Checking**: Detects and requests retransmission of lost or corrupted packets.

### **Step 6: Rendering the Webpage**
1. **Browser Decryption**:
   - **TLS**: Uses the session key to decrypt the received HTTP response.
2. **Content Display**:
   - **HTML Parsing**: Browser parses the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render the webpage for viewing.

### **Step 7: Connection Termination**
1. **Closing the Connection**:
   - **Four-Way Handshake**:
     - **FIN**: Client or server sends a FIN (finish) packet to initiate termination.
     - **ACK**: Receiver acknowledges with an ACK.
     - **FIN**: Receiver sends its own FIN.
     - **ACK**: Original sender acknowledges with an ACK.
2. **TLS Closure**:
   - **Closure Alerts**: Both parties send TLS closure alerts to gracefully terminate the secure channel.
