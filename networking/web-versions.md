Evolution of the **web** across three major stages: **Web 1.0**, **Web 2.0**, and **Web 3.0**. These stages represent the development of the internet from static pages to dynamic, user-centric platforms, and now towards a decentralized and more intelligent web.

Hereâ€™s an explanation for each stage:

### **Web 1.0 (1990-2005)**
- **Basic Web Pages**: Web 1.0 was largely static. The content on websites was fixed and could not be interacted with by the user.
- **HTML**: Web pages were primarily written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which is the standard language for creating web pages.
- **Ecommerce**: This period marked the beginning of online shopping, where businesses started selling products and services over the internet.
- **Java & JavaScript**: These programming languages began to enhance the functionality of websites. JavaScript enabled interactive elements while Java provided back-end functionalities.

### **Web 2.0 (2006-Present Day)**
- **Social Media**: The emergence of social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) where users can create and share content with others.
- **User Generated Content**: Websites like YouTube, TikTok, and blogs became popular, allowing users to create content instead of just consuming it.
- **Mobile Access**: Web 2.0 made websites mobile-friendly, allowing users to access the web on smartphones and tablets.
- **High-Quality Camera & Video**: The integration of high-resolution cameras in smartphones allowed video-sharing and streaming to become a prominent feature of the web.
- **Apps**: Mobile applications became a central part of user experience, providing personalized and interactive features.
- **High-Speed Communication**: Broadband and mobile internet connectivity improved, providing faster access to content and services.
- **Global Internet Access**: The web became widely accessible, with more and more people around the world coming online.

### **Web 3.0 (Imminent)**
- **Semantic Web**: Web 3.0 aims to make data more machine-readable and interconnected, enabling better understanding and interaction between data.
- **dApps (Decentralized Applications)**: These are apps that run on decentralized networks, making them less reliant on centralized authorities (e.g., Ethereum-based apps).
- **Users Monetize Their Data**: Web 3.0 enables users to have control over their own data and even profit from it, as seen in platforms like the blockchain.
- **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)**: Digital ownership of assets (like art, music, or virtual goods) through blockchain technology.
- **VR & AR (Metaverse)**: Virtual reality and augmented reality technologies are expected to merge in the Metaverse, creating immersive virtual worlds.
- **Permissionless Blockchains**: Blockchains that allow anyone to participate, facilitating decentralized and transparent systems.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: AI is expected to enhance personalization and automation across the web, helping to make smarter decisions.
- **Interoperability**: Web 3.0 will allow different applications and systems to seamlessly interact and work together, without silos.

### **Conclusion**
- Web 1.0 was the early, static version of the internet, focusing on delivering content.  
- Web 2.0 introduced user interaction, dynamic content, and social networks.  
- Web 3.0 is about decentralization, user empowerment, and smarter, more interactive applications.
