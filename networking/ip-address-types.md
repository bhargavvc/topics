Certainly! Understanding IP (Internet Protocol) addresses is fundamental to networking and internet communications. IP addresses are numerical labels assigned to devices connected to a network (such as WiFi, LAN, Ethernet) or through an Internet Service Provider (ISP) like Jio or Airtel. Networks use IP addresses for communication between devices.

**IP Address has two primary functions**:
- **Identifying the host or network interface**
- **Providing the location of the host in the network**

Below, we delve into the various types of IP addresses, their definitions, assignment authorities, and real-time uses, complete with specific examples to enhance understanding.
