U can aruge with interviewr if u know the concept more depth .. 


# Tell u have experiance on this [topic or concept or code or implementaiton]
  ->If they ask quesiton on that try to answer based on what you know and what u workde on ur project wat type of task u used
    -> If u storngly and confident strict to that 
     -> else SAY PLOITELY .
       -> I never came across this scenario and implementation .
         -> Sure i will follow and explore this .
