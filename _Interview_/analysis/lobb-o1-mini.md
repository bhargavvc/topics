But for me the Timestamp difference between the multiple messages matter when consuming by the worker. And it matters in a way that the service that put message into the broker. That service may introduce duplicate message like let say nano seconds time stamp difference how do you handle at the worker level because you are supposed to process only once.

**H:** So, it's sending duplicated messages with nanosecond timestamp differences. How do you handle at the worker level?

### **Your Response:**
**B:** We can configure the timestamps or we can store service types in db .. or maintain the msg queue status.

*(You asked: What is the best way to handle this situation)*

### **Analysis:**

#### **What the Interviewer is Expecting:**

#### **Suggested Improved Response:**
"To handle duplicate messages in a message broker like RabbitMQ, I would implement an idempotency strategy at the worker level. This can be achieved by assigning a unique identifier to each message. When a worker receives a message, it first checks a datastore (such as Redis or a relational database) to see if the message ID has already been processed. If it has, the worker skips processing; if not, it proceeds and records the ID after successful processing. Additionally, configuring message acknowledgment in RabbitMQ ensures that messages are not re-delivered in case of processing failures. This approach ensures that each message is processed only once, maintaining data integrity."

  - Explain how each part of your solution works in practice.
  - Reference specific features or tools in RabbitMQ that aid in deduplication.

#### **Suggested Improved Response:**
"To handle duplicate messages in RabbitMQ, I would implement an idempotency strategy using unique message identifiers. Each message would include a unique ID, which the worker would check against a datastore (like Redis or a database) before processing. If the ID exists, the worker skips processing to prevent duplication. Additionally, I would leverage RabbitMQ's message acknowledgments to ensure that messages are not requeued if they've been successfully processed. For more robust deduplication, RabbitMQ plugins or external middleware can be used to filter out duplicates before they reach the consumer. This combination ensures that each message is processed only once, maintaining data integrity."
