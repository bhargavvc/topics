### **Stage 3: Handling Missing Data and Flask Deployment on AWS EC2**

#### **Question 1:**
*How do you handle missing data in Pandas?*

#### **Your Response:**
> "So if you want, you can fill this missing data with the default value. Okay. Like, fill now is there. Like, if you want to clear that any null values, you can use the drop commands.
>
> You can set the custom commands by using, index.set_columns to we you can specify custom columns also. Right? And if you want to identify, you can use is_null. I think is_null something. We can use that function as input functions.
>
> We can specify the column name also. Like, for suppose you know that there is a column, second column, you want to fill that column with the missing value. What are the missing values you need to fill? Just need to use df.column and fillna with the whatever your desired value with the default. This column is missed already in here.
>
> And, there are cases you can be used if any statistical data you can use, mean, median, those kind of things. Like, it depends on the data and depends on what you want to feed to that, existing data frame."

#### **Strengths:**
- **Basic Techniques:** Mentioned common methods for handling missing data such as filling with default values, dropping nulls, and using statistical methods like mean and median.
- **Flexibility:** Acknowledged that the approach depends on the data and the specific requirements of the project.

#### **Areas for Improvement:**

- **Technical Accuracy:** Ensure correct usage of Pandas functions and terminology.
- **Detail and Examples:** Providing code snippets or specific examples would strengthen the explanation.

#### **Revised Example:**
> "Handling missing data in Pandas can be approached in several ways, depending on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the analysis. Here are some common methods:
>
> **1. Removing Missing Data:**
> - **Drop Rows with Missing Values:**
>   ```python
>   df.dropna(inplace=True)
>   ```
> - **Drop Columns with Missing Values:**
>   ```python
>   df.dropna(axis=1, inplace=True)
>   ```
>
> **2. Filling Missing Data:**
> - **Fill with a Specific Value:**
>   ```python
>   df['column_name'].fillna('default_value', inplace=True)
>   ```
> - **Fill with Mean, Median, or Mode:**
>   ```python
>   # Fill with mean
>   df['column_name'].fillna(df['column_name'].mean(), inplace=True)
>
>   # Fill with median
>   df['column_name'].fillna(df['column_name'].median(), inplace=True)
>
>   # Fill with mode
>   df['column_name'].fillna(df['column_name'].mode()[0], inplace=True)
>   ```
>
> **3. Forward Fill or Backward Fill:**
> - **Forward Fill:** Propagates the last valid observation forward.
>   ```python
>   df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)
>   ```
> - **Backward Fill:** Uses the next valid observation to fill gaps.
>   ```python
>   df.fillna(method='bfill', inplace=True)
>   ```
>
> **4. Interpolation:**
> - **Linear Interpolation:**
>   ```python
>   df['column_name'].interpolate(method='linear', inplace=True)
>   ```
>
> **5. Conditional Filling:**
> - **Using Custom Functions:**
>   ```python
>   df['column_name'] = df.apply(lambda row: 'custom_value' if pd.isnull(row['column_name']) else row['column_name'], axis=1)
>   ```
>
> **Choosing the Right Method:**
> - **Data Analysis:** It's essential to understand the distribution and significance of the missing data before deciding on the method.
> - **Impact on Analysis:** Consider how each method affects the overall analysis and results.
>
> **Example Scenario:**
> Suppose you have a DataFrame with a column 'Age' that has missing values. You might choose to fill these missing values with the median age to maintain the distribution:
> ```python
> df['Age'].fillna(df['Age'].median(), inplace=True)
> ```
>
> This approach ensures that the missing 'Age' values are replaced with a value that represents the central tendency of the data without introducing significant bias."

#### **Question 2:**
*How do you deploy a Flask application on AWS EC2?*

#### **Your Response:**
> "Flask application, my entire application Mhmm.
>
> On EC2? Yes. I think we can, we need to first do take the creating a launch temp launch templates we need to create. And sometimes, if you want to do the automatic triggers, you can need to specify. But we need to set the auto scaling, like, groups also.
>
> We need to specify which ports need to access that instance. And those things, we need to specify easy to. I think yeah. We need to specify the, so many kind of, like launching instance we need to do. And we need to specify the YAML file is that default.
>
> Like, you need to specify the update and the install Flask application. We have one, template is there now by default when you're creating instance with the set set of configurations. You need to set set up inside that commands, you need to set set up. And, you need to specify the app ENV, everything. And, I think we need to focus on the mostly, on the firewall because the EC2 can be within a restricted area also.
>
> Right? So you need to allow the whitelist our ports as well. Like, if our EC2 wants to communicate with the frontend application like React or some kind of thing, we need to specify that port also, HTTP and HTTPS like 80. Those kind of ports also you need to specify. And, you can configure the, I think, reverse proxy also you can configure."

#### **Strengths:**
- **Awareness of Key Steps:** Recognized the importance of launch templates, port configurations, and reverse proxies in deploying a Flask application on EC2.
- **Understanding of Security:** Mentioned firewall configurations and whitelisting ports, indicating an understanding of security best practices.

### **Stage 4: Understanding Python Generators**

#### **Question:**
*What are Python generators? How do they differ from regular functions?*

#### **Your Response:**
> "It's a default because situations may come like you have a large amount of your data files or large amount of your data. And you want to access data one by one. You don't want to access all data at once.
>
> And, you can go with the generators. Generators, by default, provide an easy load. Okay. It means, like, if you want to access next to data, you need to pass a keyword. So what happens now if you declare any list variable with the 1,000 like, millions or list variable value.
>
> For suppose if you want to print it, every element in the 1,000 1,000 as a range, if you take that way, list automatically takes initialize the memory for the 1,000 values. But if you use a generator, it only remembers the previous state, and it will give the value one by one. Okay? Instead of giving all data at once.
>
> You can get this data using a for loop or you can get a generator object inside a list. So if you pass list of generator objects, it will give the values also. So you can access in multiple ways."

#### **Strengths:**
- **Basic Understanding:** Demonstrated a fundamental understanding of Python generators, particularly their ability to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Memory Efficiency:** Recognized that generators are more memory-efficient compared to lists when dealing with large amounts of data.

#### **Areas for Improvement:**
- **Clarity and Structure:** The explanation is somewhat unclear and could benefit from a more organized approach.
- **Technical Specificity:** Provide precise definitions and code examples to illustrate the differences between generators and regular functions.
- **Terminology Accuracy:** Ensure correct use of terms (e.g., "lazy evaluation" instead of "easy load").

#### **Revised Example:**
> "Python generators are a special type of iterator that allow you to iterate over a sequence of values lazily, meaning they generate values on the fly and do not store the entire sequence in memory. This makes generators highly efficient for handling large datasets or streams of data.
>
> **Differences Between Generators and Regular Functions:**
>
> **1. Definition:**
> - **Regular Functions:** Use the `return` statement to send back a value and terminate the function.
> - **Generators:** Use the `yield` statement to produce a value and pause the function's execution, allowing it to resume later.
>
> **2. Memory Consumption:**
> - **Regular Functions:** Store all return values in memory at once, which can be inefficient for large datasets.
> - **Generators:** Produce one value at a time and only hold one value in memory, making them more memory-efficient.
>
> **3. Usage:**
> - **Regular Functions:** Suitable for operations where all results are needed immediately.
> - **Generators:** Ideal for operations where you need to process data incrementally or handle infinite sequences.
>
> **4. Syntax:**
> - **Regular Function Example:**
>   ```python
>   def get_numbers():
>       return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>
>   numbers = get_numbers()
>   for number in numbers:
>       print(number)
>   ```
>
> - **Generator Function Example:**
>   ```python
>   def generate_numbers():
>       for i in range(1, 6):
>           yield i
>
>   numbers = generate_numbers()
>   for number in numbers:
>       print(number)
>   ```
>
> **5. Performance:**
> - **Regular Functions:** Can lead to high memory usage with large data.
> - **Generators:** Improve performance by reducing memory footprint and enabling the handling of large or even infinite data streams.
>
> **Example Scenario:**
> Suppose you need to process a large log file. Using a regular function:
> ```python
> def read_logs():
>     with open('large_log_file.txt') as file:
>         return file.readlines()
>
> logs = read_logs()
> for log in logs:
>     process(log)
> ```
> This approach loads the entire file into memory, which can be problematic with very large files.
>
> Using a generator:
> ```python
> def read_logs():
>     with open('large_log_file.txt') as file:
>         for line in file:
>             yield line
>
> logs = read_logs()
> for log in logs:
>     process(log)
> ```
> This approach reads and processes one line at a time, significantly reducing memory usage."

>
> Yes. Tell me. Yes. Yes. I can.
>
> Oh, no. You got it. You finished. Yeah. Yeah.
>
> Basically, here, like, a dev ops senior engineer did. When I'm trying to do new implementation, also, like, our CTO will tell you focus on mostly backend, and you can take whenever that guy is not that you just go and do. But, they will give the privileges, but we don't have access to. But I have complete, like, building application and, how this Kubernetes and Jenkins and able to communicate how it's like. I have entire like, I have build a custom projects also from my side apart from the office work also I have done.
>
> And I have the all the repos, and I have all the access also. But I'm just waiting for one more opportunity to completely put more focus on that. Like, because backend, I used to develop and apply APIs, but I need to be part in deployments also. Right? So I'm waiting for any good opportunity to, like, complete the deployments also.
