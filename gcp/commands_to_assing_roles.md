Hereâ€™s a summary of the commands you ran and their purpose, organized step-by-step:

---

### **Commands Run and Their Purpose**

#### **1. Verify Existing Service Accounts**
```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts list --project=learning-assitant
```
- **Why**: To confirm that the `my-compute-sa` service account exists in the project.

---

#### **2. Create a Service Account (if missing)**
```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create my-compute-sa \
  --description="Service account for Cloud Build and Cloud Run" \
  --display-name="My Compute SA" \
  --project=learning-assistant
```
- **Why**: To create the `my-compute-sa` service account if it didnâ€™t already exist.

---

#### **3. Grant `roles/run.admin` to Cloud Build**
```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding learning-assistant \
  --member="serviceAccount:1095466237143@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/run.admin"
```
- **Why**: To allow the Cloud Build service account to deploy services to Cloud Run.

---

#### **4. Allow Cloud Build to Impersonate `my-compute-sa`**
```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
  my-compute-sa@learning-assitant.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --member="serviceAccount:1095466237143@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountUser"
```
- **Why**: To enable Cloud Build to "act as" the `my-compute-sa` service account during deployment.

---

#### **5. Grant Additional Permissions to `my-compute-sa`**
```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding learning-assistant \
  --member="serviceAccount:my-compute-sa@learning-assitant.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/storage.admin"
```
- **Why**: To allow `my-compute-sa` to access storage resources, such as Artifact Registry.

---

#### **6. Verify IAM Policies**
```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy my-compute-sa@learning-assitant.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```
- **Why**: To confirm that `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` was successfully assigned to `1095466237143@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com`.

```bash
gcloud projects get-iam-policy learning-assistant
```
- **Why**: To check the project-level IAM bindings and ensure all necessary roles were assigned.

---

#### **7. Authenticate and Set Project**
```bash
gcloud auth list
```
- **Why**: To confirm the authenticated user.

```bash
gcloud config set account bhargav.dev01@gmail.com
```
- **Why**: To explicitly set the active account.

```bash
gcloud config set project learning-assistant
```
- **Why**: To ensure all commands target the correct project.

---

#### **8. Submit the Build**
```bash
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.yaml
```
- **Why**: To execute the build and deployment process as defined in the `cloudbuild.yaml` file.

---

### **Why These Steps Were Necessary**
1. **Service Account Setup**: The deployment required a specific service account (`my-compute-sa`) with sufficient roles to manage resources in Cloud Run and Artifact Registry.
2. **Cloud Build Permissions**: Cloud Build needed permissions to impersonate the service account (`roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`) and deploy to Cloud Run (`roles/run.admin`).
3. **Project Configuration**: Proper project setup and authentication ensured that all operations targeted the correct Google Cloud project.
