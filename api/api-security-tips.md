### **2. Strong Authentication**
**Purpose:** Ensure only authorized users access the API.

**Examples:**
- Use OAuth 2.0 for token-based authentication.
- Implement MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).

**Best Practices:**
- Do not store plaintext passwords.
- Rotate client secrets regularly.

**Real-World Example:**  
A GitHub OAuth app requiring two-factor authentication for sensitive operations like repository deletion.

### **5. Rate Limiting**
**Purpose:** Prevent API abuse and DoS attacks.

**How It Works:**
- Set a maximum number of requests allowed per unit time.
- Return `429 Too Many Requests` when exceeded.

**Best Practices:**
- Different tiers for free vs. premium users.
- Use API gateways or NGINX to implement limits.

**Real-World Example:**  
GitHub’s API limits requests per hour, encouraging efficient usage and preventing abuse.

### **7. Token Expiration**
**Purpose:** Limit token lifespan to reduce potential misuse.

**How It Works:**
- Issue short-lived tokens (e.g., 15 minutes).
- Provide refresh tokens for longer sessions.

**Best Practices:**
- Rotate tokens frequently.
- Revoke tokens upon logout or suspect activity.

**Real-World Example:**  
**AWS IAM** access tokens expire quickly, requiring frequent renewal to minimize risk.

### **20. Use CSRF Tokens**
**Purpose:** Prevent **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** attacks where attackers trick authenticated users into sending malicious requests.

**How It Works:**
- Include a unique, random token in every API request that modifies state.
- The server validates the token to confirm the request is legitimate.

**Best Practices:**
- Use frameworks with built-in CSRF protection (e.g., **Django**, **Spring**).
- Expire tokens after a set time.

**Real-World Example:**  
Web applications like **Gmail** or **GitHub** use CSRF tokens to ensure that a user's browser cannot be tricked into sending unauthorized actions on their behalf.

## **Server-to-Client Security**

### **3. Access Control**
**Purpose:** Ensure the right users have the right permissions.

**How It Works:**
- Implement RBAC and ABAC (Role-based access control, Attribute-based access control).
- Check permissions on every request.

**Best Practices:**
- Adhere to the principle of least privilege.
- Use centralized IAM solutions like **Keycloak** or **AWS IAM**.

**Real-World Example:**  
An internal corporate API grants admin-level access only to certain authenticated and authorized employees.

### **4. Data Encryption**
**Purpose:** Protect data both in transit and at rest.

**How It Works:**
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all API requests.
- Store sensitive data (like passwords) hashed and salted.

**Best Practices:**
- Rotate encryption keys periodically.
- Use trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) for SSL certificates.

**Real-World Example:**  
A healthcare API encrypts patient data in the database and uses HTTPS for all traffic.

---

### **11. Security Headers**
**Purpose:** Enhance response security using headers.

**Examples:**
- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP):** Prevents XSS attacks.
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):** Enforces HTTPS usage.

**Best Practices:**
- Use tools like **Helmet.js** to set headers easily.

**Real-World Example:**  
Modern browsers enforcing CSP prevents malicious scripts from running on the site.

### **14. CORS Configuration**
**Purpose:** Control which domains can make cross-origin requests.

**How It Works:**
- Set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to allowed domains.
- Avoid using `*` in production.

**Best Practices:**
- Only whitelist trusted domains.
- Enable preflight checks for POST or PUT requests.

**Real-World Example:**  
An e-commerce API only allows its official frontend domain to make cross-origin requests, blocking malicious sites.

### **15. Safe API Documentation**
**Purpose:** Prevent the accidental leak of credentials or internal endpoints in documentation.

**Best Practices:**
- Exclude API keys or secrets from docs.
- Use tools like **Swagger** or **Redoc** to generate secure documentation.

**Real-World Example:**  
Public API docs for a social media platform only list public endpoints, never exposing admin APIs or tokens.

### **17. Disable Default Errors**
**Purpose:** Prevent attackers from exploiting detailed error messages that reveal system internals.

**How It Works:**
- Replace stack traces and detailed errors with generic messages.
- Log detailed errors internally for debugging.

**Best Practices:**
- Show “Internal Server Error” to the user.
- Hide database schema details from the response.

**Real-World Example:**  
A payment API returns a generic "Something went wrong" message instead of revealing SQL query errors.

[Go to Top](#20-api-security-tips)

### **19. API Versioning**
**Purpose:** Securely roll out updates without breaking older clients.

**How It Works:**
- Deprecate outdated versions gradually.
- Encourage clients to migrate to newer, more secure versions.

**Best Practices:**
- Include version indicators in URLs (e.g., `/v1`, `/v2`).
- Announce deprecation timelines clearly.

**Real-World Example:**  
**Twitter API v1.1** was eventually deprecated in favor of newer versions with improved security measures.
