  const client = jwksClient({
    jwksUri: 'https://auth.shopease.com/.well-known/jwks.json'
  });

  function getKey(header, callback) {
    client.getSigningKey(header.kid, function(err, key) {
      const signingKey = key.publicKey || key.rsaPublicKey;
      callback(null, signingKey);
    });
  }

  exports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {
    const token = event.headers.Authorization.split(' ')[1];

    jwt.verify(token, getKey, {}, function(err, decoded) {
      if (err) {
        return callback(null, {
          statusCode: 401,
          body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Unauthorized' })
        });
      }
      // Proceed with authorized request
      callback(null, {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Authorized', user: decoded })
      });
    });
  };
  ```

          transform:
            rename:
              name: title
    response:
      templates:
        - match: /products
          transform:
            filter:
              - id
              - title
              - price
  aggregation:
    endpoints:
      - /products
      - /inventory
    combine:
      method: merge
      fields:
        - productId: id
        - stock: inventory.stock
  ```

#### **Pros:**

- **Validate Transformed Data:** Ensure that transformed responses adhere to expected schemas and formats to prevent client-side issues.
- **Document Transformation Rules:** Maintain clear documentation of all transformation and aggregation rules for transparency and ease of maintenance.

#### **ShopEase Example Enhancement:**

- **Implementing Response Transformation Using AWS API Gateway Mapping Templates:**
  ```json
  {
    "id": "$input.json('$.id')",
    "title": "$input.json('$.name')",
    "price": "$input.json('$.price')"
  }
  ```

- **Aggregating Responses from Multiple Services Using AWS Lambda:**
  ```javascript
  // Example Lambda function for response aggregation
  const axios = require('axios');

  exports.handler = async (event) => {
      const productId = event.pathParameters.id;

      // Fetch product details
      const productResponse = await axios.get(`https://api.shopease.com/v2/products/${productId}`);

      // Fetch inventory status
      const inventoryResponse = await axios.get(`https://api.shopease.com/v2/inventory/${productId}`);

      // Aggregate responses
      const aggregatedResponse = {
          id: productResponse.data.id,
          title: productResponse.data.title,
          price: productResponse.data.price,
          stock: inventoryResponse.data.stock
      };

      return {
          statusCode: 200,
          body: JSON.stringify(aggregatedResponse)
      };
  };
  ```

2. **API Gateway Receives Request:**
   - The gateway acts as the single entry point, receiving all incoming requests.
   
3. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - The gateway validates the client's identity and permissions using tokens or API keys.
   
4. **Rate Limiting and Throttling:**
   - The gateway checks if the client has exceeded any predefined rate limits or quotas.
   
5. **Routing:**
   - Based on the request path and method, the gateway routes the request to the appropriate backend service.
   
6. **Request Transformation (if applicable):**
   - The gateway modifies the request data to match the backend service's expected format.
   
7. **Backend Service Processing:**
   - The targeted microservice processes the request and generates a response.
   
8. **Response Transformation (if applicable):**
   - The gateway alters the backend response to suit the client's requirements.
   
9. **Caching (if applicable):**
   - The gateway caches the response for future similar requests, enhancing performance.
   
10. **Response Handling:**
    - The gateway sends the final response back to the client.

#### **ShopEase Example:**

- **Scenario:** A client requests product details from ShopEase.
  
- **Flow:**
  1. **Request:** `GET https://api.shopease.com/v2/products/1`
  2. **Authentication:** API Gateway validates the JWT token provided in the `Authorization` header.
  3. **Rate Limiting:** Checks if the client has not exceeded the allowed request rate.
  4. **Routing:** Routes the request to the Product Service (`product-service-v2`).
  5. **Processing:** Product Service retrieves product data from the database.
  6. **Response Transformation:** Renames fields (`name` to `title`) before sending the response.
  7. **Caching:** Caches the transformed response for future requests.
  8. **Response:** API Gateway returns the final JSON response to the client.

### 5.3 Throttling and Quotas

#### **Concept:**

**Throttling** and **Quotas** are mechanisms to control the rate and volume of requests that clients can make to an API. These features help prevent abuse, ensure fair usage, and protect backend services from being overwhelmed by excessive traffic.

#### **Throttling:**

- **Rate Limiting:** Restricts the number of requests a client can make within a specified time frame (e.g., 1000 requests per minute).
- **Burst Control:** Allows temporary spikes in traffic by permitting short bursts of requests above the rate limit.
- **Dynamic Throttling:** Adjusts rate limits based on real-time conditions or client behavior.

#### **Quotas:**

- **Usage Limits:** Sets hard limits on the total number of requests a client can make over longer periods (e.g., 10,000 requests per day).
- **Tiered Access:** Defines different quota levels for various client tiers (e.g., free vs. premium clients).
- **Quota Enforcement:** Automatically enforces quota limits, preventing clients from exceeding their allocated usage.

#### **Implementation with ShopEase:**

- **Rate Limiting Policies:**
  ```yaml
  throttling:
    rateLimit: 1000  # requests per minute
    burstLimit: 200   # maximum burst size
  ```
  
- **Quota Policies:**
  ```yaml
  quotas:
    dailyLimit: 10000  # requests per day
    monthlyLimit: 300000  # requests per month
    tiers:
      - name: Free
        dailyLimit: 5000
        monthlyLimit: 150000
      - name: Premium
        dailyLimit: 10000
        monthlyLimit: 300000
  ```

#### **Pros:**

- **Protect Backend Services:** Safeguards against traffic spikes and ensures backend stability.
- **Manage Costs:** Controls operational costs by limiting excessive usage.
- **Enhance Security:** Mitigates denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and other abusive behaviors.

#### **Cons:**

- **Client Frustration:** Legitimate clients might experience request denials if they exceed limits.
- **Complex Configuration:** Determining appropriate limits requires careful analysis of usage patterns.

#### **Best Practices:**

- **Define Appropriate Limits:** Balance between allowing legitimate traffic and preventing abuse by analyzing typical usage patterns.
- **Provide Feedback:** Inform clients when they approach or exceed rate limits through appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests).
- **Implement Graceful Degradation:** Allow clients to retry after a specified time or provide alternative responses when limits are reached.
- **Monitor and Adjust:** Continuously track API usage and adjust rate limits as necessary to accommodate changing demand.

#### **ShopEase Example Enhancement:**

- **Configuring Rate Limiting and Quotas in AWS API Gateway:**
  ```bash
  # Creating a usage plan with rate and burst limits
  aws apigateway create-usage-plan --name "BasicPlan" \
      --throttle burstLimit=200,rateLimit=1000 \
      --quota limit=10000,period=DAY \
      --api-stages apiId=<api-id>,stage=<stage-name>
  
  # Associating an API key with the usage plan
  aws apigateway create-usage-plan-key --usage-plan-id <usage-plan-id> \
      --key-id <api-key-id> --key-type API_KEY
  ```

- **Implementing Tiered Quotas:**
  ```yaml
  quotas:
    tiers:
      - name: Free
        description: "Basic access for free tier users."
        limits:
          daily: 5000
          monthly: 150000
      - name: Premium
        description: "Enhanced access for premium tier users."
        limits:
          daily: 10000
          monthly: 300000
  ```

### 5.5 Event-Driven Architectures

#### **Concept:**

**Event-Driven Architectures** leverage asynchronous communication between services, enabling APIs to respond to events in real-time. Integrating API Gateways with event-driven systems (e.g., AWS Lambda) allows for scalable, serverless backends that can handle varying workloads efficiently.

#### **Key Points:**

- **Asynchronous Processing:** Decouple services to handle tasks asynchronously, improving scalability and resilience.
- **Serverless Integration:** Utilize serverless functions to execute code in response to API events without managing servers.
- **Event Streaming:** Implement event streaming platforms (e.g., Kafka, AWS Kinesis) to process and distribute events across services.

#### **Implementation with ShopEase:**

- **Using AWS Lambda for Serverless Backends:**
  ```javascript
  // Example Lambda function for processing orders
  exports.handler = async (event) => {
      const orderData = JSON.parse(event.body);
      
      // Process the order (e.g., validate, store in database)
      const result = await processOrder(orderData);
      
      return {
          statusCode: 200,
          body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Order processed successfully.", orderId: result.orderId })
      };
  };
  ```
  
- **Integrating Lambda with API Gateway:**
  ```bash
  # Creating a Lambda function
  aws lambda create-function --function-name ProcessOrder \
      --runtime nodejs14.x \
      --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/lambda-execution-role \
      --handler index.handler \
      --zip-file fileb://function.zip
  
  # Integrating Lambda with API Gateway via AWS CLI
  aws apigateway put-integration --rest-api-id <api-id> --resource-id <resource-id> \
      --http-method POST --type AWS_PROXY \
      --integration-http-method POST \
      --uri arn:aws:apigateway:<region>:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/arn:aws:lambda:<region>:123456789012:function:ProcessOrder/invocations
  ```

- **Implementing Event Streaming with AWS Kinesis:**
  ```bash
  # Creating a Kinesis Stream for order events
  aws kinesis create-stream --stream-name OrderEvents --shard-count 1
  
  # Publishing an event to the Kinesis Stream from Lambda
  const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
  const kinesis = new AWS.Kinesis();

  const params = {
      Data: JSON.stringify(orderData),
      PartitionKey: orderData.orderId.toString(),
      StreamName: 'OrderEvents'
  };

  kinesis.putRecord(params, (err, data) => {
      if (err) console.log(err, err.stack);
      else console.log(data);
  });
  ```

#### **Pros:**

- **Scalability:** Automatically scales with the volume of incoming events, handling spikes efficiently.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Pay only for the compute resources used during event processing, reducing operational costs.
- **Flexibility:** Easily integrate with various services and extend functionalities through event-driven patterns.

#### **Cons:**

- **Complexity:** Designing and managing event-driven systems can be more complex compared to synchronous architectures.
- **Latency:** Asynchronous processing may introduce delays in event handling and response times.
- **Debugging Challenges:** Tracing and debugging issues in distributed, event-driven systems can be more intricate.

#### **Best Practices:**

- **Design for Idempotency:** Ensure that event processing is idempotent to handle duplicate events gracefully.
- **Implement Dead Letter Queues:** Manage failed events by routing them to dead letter queues for later analysis and retry.
- **Monitor Event Streams:** Track event flow and processing to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.
- **Ensure Event Ordering:** If necessary, maintain the order of events to ensure consistent processing.

#### **ShopEase Example Enhancement:**

- **Setting Up an AWS Lambda Function for Event Processing:**
  ```javascript
  // Example Lambda function to handle order events from Kinesis
  exports.handler = async (event) => {
      for (const record of event.Records) {
          const orderData = Buffer.from(record.kinesis.data, 'base64').toString('utf8');
          console.log("Processing Order:", orderData);
          
          // Process the order (e.g., update inventory, notify shipping)
          await processOrder(JSON.parse(orderData));
      }
      
      return { statusCode: 200, body: "Orders processed successfully." };
  };
  ```
  
- **Configuring Lambda to Trigger from Kinesis Stream:**
  ```bash
  # Adding an event source mapping for Lambda to process Kinesis Stream events
  aws lambda create-event-source-mapping --function-name ProcessOrderEvents \
      --event-source arn:aws:kinesis:<region>:123456789012:stream/OrderEvents \
      --starting-position TRIM_HORIZON \
      --batch-size 100
  ```
