## General REST and API Design Principles

### Q1. What is a RESTful API and what are its main principles?  
**Answer:**  
A RESTful API is an application programming interface that follows the principles of REpresentational State Transfer (REST). Its main principles include:  
- **Statelessness:** Each request from the client to the server must contain all the necessary information; the server does not store session state.  
- **Uniform Interface:** A consistent way of interacting with resources (often via standardized HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).  
- **Client-Server Separation:** The client and server are independent systems.  
- **Layered System:** The architecture can have multiple layers (e.g., load balancers, caches).  
- **Cacheability:** Responses should indicate if they are cacheable to improve performance.  
- **Resource-based URIs:** Each resource should have a unique URI and be manipulated through these endpoints.

### Q2. How do the concepts of resources and representations fit into REST?  
**Answer:**  
- **Resource:** An object or concept (e.g., a user, an order) identified by a unique URI.  
- **Representation:** The specific format (JSON, XML, etc.) in which the resource is retrieved or sent. A single resource can have multiple representations.

### Q3. Can you explain the difference between PUT and PATCH?  
**Answer:**  
- **PUT:** Replaces the entire resource with the given data. It is idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests result in the same state.  
- **PATCH:** Partially updates the resource. It modifies only the fields provided in the request, leaving other fields untouched.

### Q4. What are the different HTTP methods commonly used in RESTful APIs and their typical use cases?  
**Answer:**  
- **GET:** Retrieve a resource or list of resources.  
- **POST:** Create a new resource.  
- **PUT:** Fully update an existing resource.  
- **PATCH:** Partially update an existing resource.  
- **DELETE:** Remove a resource.

### Q5. How do you handle versioning in REST APIs?  
**Answer:**  
Options include:  
- **URI Versioning:** e.g., `/v1/users/` vs `/v2/users/`  
- **Header-based Versioning:** e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.myapp.v2+json`  
- **Query Parameter Versioning:** e.g., `GET /users?version=2`  
Best practices often prefer URI or Header-based versioning for clarity and cleaner design.

### Q6. What is the difference between a resource endpoint and a sub-resource endpoint?  
**Answer:**  
- **Resource Endpoint:** Represents a top-level resource, e.g., `/users/` or `/orders/`.  
- **Sub-Resource Endpoint:** Represents a resource that logically belongs to a parent resource, e.g., `/users/123/orders/` to fetch orders related to a specific user.

### Q7. Why are statelessness and cacheability important principles in REST?  
**Answer:**  
- **Statelessness:** Simplifies server design (no session storage) and improves scalability. Each request is self-contained, making load balancing and failover easier.  
- **Cacheability:** Improves performance and scalability by reducing server load and speeding up responses.

### Q8. What does HATEOAS mean, and is it commonly used in practice?  
**Answer:**  
HATEOAS (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State) means that the API response includes links to other actions and resources. It helps clients navigate the API dynamically. While a core REST constraint, it’s less commonly implemented in simpler APIs due to complexity and overhead.

### Q9. How do you manage URL design and route structure in REST APIs?  
**Answer:**  
- Use **nouns** not verbs: `/users/` instead of `/getUsers/`.  
- Use **plural resources** for collections: `/users/`.  
- Nest resources when there is a clear hierarchy: `/users/123/orders/`.  
- Keep it **consistent** and **intuitive** across the API.

### Q10. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous API calls?  
**Answer:**  
- **Synchronous:** The client waits for a response, blocking the next action until it arrives.  
- **Asynchronous:** The client does not wait; it may receive a callback or a promise, allowing the client’s thread to continue executing while the server processes the request in the background.

## Django and Django REST Framework (DRF) Basics

### Q11. How would you create a simple API endpoint using Django REST Framework?  
**Answer:**  
1. Install DRF: `pip install djangorestframework`.  
2. Add `'rest_framework'` to `INSTALLED_APPS`.  
3. Create a `Serializer` for your model.  
4. Create a `APIView` or `ViewSet`.  
5. Map it in `urls.py` using `routers` or `path()` functions.

### Q12. Explain the role of Serializers in DRF.  
**Answer:**  
**Serializers** convert complex data types (e.g., Django model instances) into native Python datatypes, and then to JSON or XML, enabling them to be rendered into a response. They also handle incoming JSON and validate the data before converting it to model instances.

### Q13. How do you define your API URLs in DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- Use `routers` (for ViewSets) to automatically generate RESTful endpoints.  
- Use `path()` or `re_path()` in `urls.py` to map specific views.  
- Combine them if necessary, ensuring a clear, consistent URL structure.

### Q14. What are ViewSets and how do they differ from APIView in DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- **APIView:** Provides methods like `get()`, `post()` etc. You manually define all methods.  
- **ViewSet:** Groups related CRUD operations on a model automatically, allowing you to use `routers` to generate standard REST endpoints without having to write each method explicitly.

### Q15. Explain how authentication is integrated into DRF.  
**Answer:**  
DRF provides `authentication_classes` that can be applied globally or per-view. These classes (TokenAuthentication, SessionAuthentication, etc.) handle the logic of identifying the user sending the request. You can also integrate custom authentication backends or third-party packages.

### Q16. Can you describe the difference between ModelSerializer and Serializer in DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- **Serializer:** A base class where you define fields manually.  
- **ModelSerializer:** A shortcut that automatically generates fields from a specified Django model, reducing boilerplate code.

### Q17. How do you perform filtering, searching, and ordering in DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- Use `django-filter` integrated with DRF filters for advanced filtering.  
- Add `filter_backends` like `DjangoFilterBackend`, `SearchFilter`, and `OrderingFilter` in your view or viewset.  
- Define `filterset_fields`, `search_fields`, and `ordering_fields` to control behavior.

### Q18. What is the purpose of Renderers and Parsers in DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- **Renderers:** Control how response data is rendered into a specific format (JSON, XML, HTML).  
- **Parsers:** Parse incoming request data into Python objects (e.g., JSONParser for JSON requests).

### Q19. How do you implement pagination in DRF and what options are available?  
**Answer:**  
Configure `DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS` and `PAGE_SIZE` in `settings.py`. DRF supports multiple pagination styles:  
- `PageNumberPagination`  
- `LimitOffsetPagination`  
- `CursorPagination`

### Q20. What’s the use of the `APIView` class in DRF compared to generic views?  
**Answer:**  
`APIView` is a base class that provides the core functionality for request/response handling. **Generic views** build on `APIView` and provide common patterns (like `ListAPIView`, `RetrieveAPIView`), simplifying CRUD operations without rewriting boilerplate code.
 

## Authentication and Authorization

### Q21. How would you implement token-based authentication in DRF?  
**Answer:**  
1. Enable `rest_framework.authtoken` in `INSTALLED_APPS`.  
2. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the token table.  
3. Obtain the token via the `/api-token-auth/` endpoint.  
4. Include `TokenAuthentication` in your `authentication_classes` on views.  
Requests must then include `Authorization: Token <your_token>` header.

### Q22. Can you explain how JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication works in DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- **JWT Generation:** After verifying credentials (usually via a login endpoint), the server issues a JWT.  
- **Stateless Authentication:** The JWT, containing encrypted claims about the user, is sent by the client in subsequent requests (commonly in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`).  
- **Validation and Expiration:** The server checks the token’s signature and expiry. No database lookup is required for session state. Libraries like `djangorestframework-simplejwt` simplify implementation.

### Q23. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?  
**Answer:**  
- **Authentication:** The process of verifying the identity of the user (e.g., via tokens, credentials).  
- **Authorization:** Determining what resources and actions an authenticated user is allowed to access.

### Q24. How do you integrate OAuth2 with DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- Use third-party packages like `django-oauth-toolkit`.  
- Configure an OAuth2 provider, create applications, and issue tokens.  
- Add `OAuth2Authentication` to `authentication_classes`.  
This allows your DRF endpoints to consume OAuth2 tokens for authentication and permission checks.

### Q25. How can you restrict access to certain endpoints based on user roles or permissions in DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- Use `permission_classes` such as `IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdminUser`, or custom permission classes.  
- Implement custom permission classes by overriding `has_permission()` or `has_object_permission()` methods.  
- Check user roles or groups and return `True`/`False` accordingly.

### Q26. What are the built-in authentication classes in DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- `SessionAuthentication`  
- `BasicAuthentication`  
- `TokenAuthentication`  
Developers can also implement JWT Authentication via third-party packages or create custom classes.

### Q27. How would you implement custom permission classes in DRF?  
**Answer:**  
1. Create a class inheriting from `rest_framework.permissions.BasePermission`.  
2. Implement `has_permission()` or `has_object_permission()` methods to return `True` or `False`.  
3. Assign your custom permission class to `permission_classes` in your view or globally in `settings.py`.

### Q28. How do you secure API keys and secrets in a production environment?  
**Answer:**  
- Never hard-code secrets in source code.  
- Use environment variables or secret management tools (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).  
- Store secrets outside the code repository.  
- Enforce strict access controls and rotate keys regularly.

### Q29. Explain the difference between session-based and token-based authentication.  
**Answer:**  
- **Session-based:** Server stores user session data (e.g., in a database or cache). Client holds a session ID. Not truly stateless.  
- **Token-based:** No server-side session. Client holds a token (e.g., JWT) that encodes user info. Stateless, easier to scale horizontally.

### Q30. How do you handle expired or revoked tokens?  
**Answer:**  
- **For Token-based (JWT):** Include an `exp` (expiry) claim in the token. The server checks for expiration at every request. To revoke tokens, maintain a blacklist.  
- **For OAuth/OIDC:** Use a token introspection endpoint or a central token store that can invalidate tokens.  
- **For DRF Tokens:** Delete or rotate tokens from the database to prevent further use.

## Testing REST APIs and DRF

### Q31. How do you write unit tests for DRF endpoints?  
**Answer:**  
- Use Django’s `TestCase` or `APITestCase` from DRF.  
- Use DRF’s `APIClient` to simulate requests.  
- Write tests for each endpoint: check response status codes, response data validity, error handling, and authentication flows.

### Q32. Which tools and libraries can you use for API testing (e.g., pytest, requests)?  
**Answer:**  
- **pytest-django:** For running tests with pytest.  
- **requests:** For making HTTP calls in tests (though `APIClient` is preferred in DRF tests).  
- **tox:** For testing across multiple environments.  
- **factory_boy:** For creating test data.  
- **responses or httpretty:** For mocking external services.

### Q33. How would you test authentication flows in DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- Obtain a token using valid credentials via test setup.  
- Make authenticated requests with `APIClient.credentials(HTTP_AUTHORIZATION='Token <token>')`.  
- Test invalid credentials, expired tokens, and permission checks.

### Q34. How do you ensure test data isolation and rollback after running tests?  
**Answer:**  
- Django’s `TestCase` automatically wraps each test in a transaction and rolls back after the test.  
- Use fixtures or factories to create data at test setup.  
- Avoid persistent state (like external services or cached data) unless carefully managed.

### Q35. How do you load test or stress test an API endpoint?  
**Answer:**  
- Use tools like `Locust`, `JMeter`, or `k6` to simulate concurrent users and requests.  
- Measure response times, throughput, and error rates under load.  
- Identify and address bottlenecks found during load testing.

### Q36. What is the importance of mocking external services in API testing?  
**Answer:**  
- Ensures tests run quickly and reliably without dependencies on external systems.  
- Allows testing how the API responds when external services return errors or unexpected data.  
- Controls the test environment, making tests deterministic and stable.

### Q37. How would you test error handling and edge cases?  
**Answer:**  
- Deliberately send invalid input or missing required fields.  
- Simulate external service failures (using mocks).  
- Check for correct HTTP status codes and accurate error messages in responses.

### Q38. How do you manage test coverage and ensure critical paths are well tested?  
**Answer:**  
- Use coverage tools (like `coverage.py`) to measure line and branch coverage.  
- Identify critical code paths (authentication, database interactions, payment flows) and write dedicated tests.  
- Review coverage reports and add tests to cover missed scenarios.

### Q39. How do you use DRF’s test client to perform API requests during tests?  
**Answer:**  
- Import `APIClient` from `rest_framework.test`.  
- Instantiate `client = APIClient()`.  
- Use methods like `client.get()`, `client.post()`, etc.  
- Set headers and authentication as needed before making requests.

### Q40. How do you test file uploads and binary data endpoints in DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- Use `APIClient` and provide files through `client.post()` with `format='multipart'`.  
- Use Django’s `SimpleUploadedFile` or real files from a test directory.  
- Assert the response status and validate the file handling logic on the server side.

## Performance and Scalability

### Q41. How can you improve the performance of a DRF API?  
**Answer:**  
- Use **query optimization** and **select_related/prefetch_related** to reduce database queries.  
- Add **caching** (per-view or low-level).  
- Introduce **pagination** for large lists.  
- Consider **asynchronous tasks** for long-running operations.  
- Profile and optimize slow code paths.

### Q42. What techniques are used to cache responses in DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- Use DRF’s `throttle_classes` and caching decorators.  
- Integrate Django’s cache framework (e.g., Redis or Memcached).  
- Implement HTTP caching headers like `ETag` or `Last-Modified`.

### Q43. How do you implement HTTP caching headers (ETags, Last-Modified) in DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- Override `get_queryset()` or `list()` methods to compute `ETag` or `Last-Modified` values.  
- Use Django’s `ConditionalGetMiddleware` or manually set `ETag`/`Last-Modified` headers on response objects.  
- When the client provides `If-None-Match` or `If-Modified-Since`, return `304 Not Modified` if conditions are met.

### Q44. How would you use database indexing to speed up API queries?  
**Answer:**  
- Identify frequently queried fields and add indexes at the database level.  
- Use `db_index=True` on model fields or run database migrations to add explicit indexes.  
- Monitor query performance via Django’s `QuerySet.explain()` or database logs.

### Q45. How do you handle large datasets and paginated responses efficiently?  
**Answer:**  
- Use `PageNumberPagination`, `LimitOffsetPagination`, or `CursorPagination` to return subsets of data.  
- Optimize queries to fetch only required fields.  
- Pre-compute and cache expensive aggregations or results.

### Q46. What is the N+1 query problem and how do you solve it in Django/DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- **N+1 Problem:** Occurs when fetching related data triggers additional queries for each item, leading to a large number of queries.  
- **Solution:** Use `select_related()` for one-to-one/foreign key relationships and `prefetch_related()` for many-to-many or reverse foreign keys to fetch related data in fewer queries.

### Q47. How do you profile and measure the performance of your DRF endpoints?  
**Answer:**  
- Use Django’s built-in `django-debug-toolbar` for dev environments.  
- Integrate APM tools (New Relic, Datadog, Sentry Performance) in production.  
- Write load tests and measure response times, CPU usage, memory footprint.

### Q48. Can you integrate caching layers like Redis or Memcached with DRF?  
**Answer:**  
Yes. Configure Django’s cache settings to use Redis or Memcached. Then apply caching strategies at the view level (e.g., `@method_decorator(cache_page(60*15))` on views) or in business logic. DRF responses can benefit greatly from a proper caching layer.

### Q49. How do you scale a DRF-based application horizontally?  
**Answer:**  
- Run multiple instances of the application behind a load balancer.  
- Use containers (Docker, Kubernetes) for easy scaling.  
- Ensure the application is stateless and relies on shared external services (e.g., database, cache).  
- Monitor and add more instances as load increases.

### Q50. What load balancing strategies have you used for scaling REST APIs?  
**Answer:**  
- **Round Robin:** Distribute requests evenly.  
- **Least Connections:** Send new requests to the server with the fewest connections.  
- **IP Hash:** Route requests from the same client to the same server (session stickiness).  
Tools: Nginx, HAProxy, AWS ELB/ALB, or GCP Load Balancers.

## Security and Best Practices

### Q51. What are common security vulnerabilities in REST APIs and how do you mitigate them?  
**Answer:**  
- **SQL Injection:** Use parameterized queries or Django’s ORM to prevent malicious SQL.  
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Use CSRF tokens or rely on stateless token-based auth instead of cookies.  
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Properly escape output, sanitize input.  
- **Broken Authentication:** Use secure tokens (JWT with short expiry), enforce HTTPS, and revoke compromised tokens.  
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Encrypt data in transit (TLS), avoid storing sensitive info in plain text.  
- **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring:** Implement proper logging, alerting, and use a WAF (Web Application Firewall).

### Q52. How do you prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- DRF’s default `SessionAuthentication` enforces CSRF for web-based sessions.  
- When using token-based or JWT auth, CSRF tokens are not typically required since you’re not using browser-based sessions.  
- If needed, ensure clients send the `X-CSRFToken` header and verify it server-side.

### Q53. How do you handle rate limiting and throttling in DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- Configure `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES` and `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES` in `settings.py`.  
- Use built-in classes like `UserRateThrottle`, `AnonRateThrottle`, or create custom throttles.  
- Set rates (e.g., `user: 100/minute`) to control the number of requests allowed.

### Q54. How can you encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest for APIs?  
**Answer:**  
- **In Transit:** Use HTTPS (TLS/SSL) to encrypt all traffic between clients and the server.  
- **At Rest:** Use database encryption, encrypted file systems, or application-level encryption (e.g., using Django’s `cryptography` library or a KMS like AWS KMS).

### Q55. How do you safely handle file uploads via REST endpoints?  
**Answer:**  
- Validate file types and sizes.  
- Store files in a safe location, such as cloud storage (S3) or a protected directory.  
- Scan files for viruses or malware if necessary.  
- Restrict who can upload and ensure proper authentication.

### Q56. What steps do you take to validate and sanitize user input?  
**Answer:**  
- Use DRF serializers’ built-in validation and custom `validate_<field>` methods.  
- Strip or escape user-provided strings to prevent XSS.  
- Enforce data types and format checks (e.g., email fields, regex validators).
- Reject or handle invalid data gracefully.

### Q57. How do you protect against SQL injection and other injection attacks?  
**Answer:**  
- Use Django’s ORM or parameterized queries rather than building SQL strings manually.  
- Validate and sanitize input.  
- Avoid unsafe string concatenation with user input.

### Q58. Explain how you would integrate Content Security Policy (CSP) for your API.  
**Answer:**  
- CSP is primarily for browsers to prevent malicious scripts.  
- For APIs that return HTML, include the `Content-Security-Policy` header to restrict which sources can load scripts, styles, and other resources.  
- For JSON APIs, CSP is less relevant since they are not directly rendered by browsers, but if you return HTML in some endpoints, CSP helps mitigate XSS.

### Q59. How do you handle sensitive data in logs and error responses?  
**Answer:**  
- Don’t log passwords, tokens, or personal information.  
- Mask or redact sensitive fields before logging.  
- Configure logging handlers/formatters to omit or filter sensitive data.  
- Return generic error messages to clients without exposing internal details.

### Q60. How do you handle OAuth scopes and permissions to restrict API access?  
**Answer:**  
- Define scopes that represent different permission levels (read-only, write, admin).  
- Issue access tokens with specific scopes.  
- Check the token’s scopes in your view’s permission logic.  
- Deny access if the required scope is not present.

## Advanced DRF and Django Concepts

### Q61. What are custom actions in DRF ViewSets and how do you create them?  
**Answer:**  
- Custom actions are additional endpoints besides the standard CRUD actions.  
- Use the `@action` decorator on ViewSet methods.  
- Specify `detail=True` for actions operating on a single object, `detail=False` for collection-level actions.

### Q62. How do you integrate DRF with Django’s built-in admin or other admin panels?  
**Answer:**  
- DRF and Django admin are separate concerns. The admin manages Django models, while DRF exposes them as APIs.  
- You can run them side-by-side: the Django admin at `/admin/` and DRF endpoints at `/api/`.  
- For more complex needs, build custom admin views or use the Django admin’s `ModelAdmin` to manage data displayed in the API.

### Q63. How do you implement complex query filters with Q objects and DRF filters?  
**Answer:**  
- In DRF views, override `get_queryset()` and use Django’s `Q` objects to create complex filters with `AND`/`OR` logic.  
- Combine this with DRF’s `filter_backends` for additional filtering.  
- Example: `queryset = MyModel.objects.filter(Q(name__icontains='test') | Q(status='active'))`

### Q64. Describe the process for building a custom authentication class in DRF.  
**Answer:**  
1. Inherit from `BaseAuthentication`.  
2. Implement `authenticate(self, request)` method, returning `(user, None)` if successful, `None` otherwise.  
3. In settings or views, add this class to `authentication_classes`.

### Q65. How do you serve different formats (JSON, XML) with DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- Add `Renderer` classes (e.g., `JSONRenderer`, `XMLRenderer`) in `DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES`.  
- Clients can specify `Accept` headers (e.g., `Accept: application/xml`) and DRF will pick the appropriate renderer.  
- Or append format suffixes to the URL (e.g., `/users.json`, `/users.xml`) if enabled.

### Q66. How do you handle internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) in DRF responses?  
**Answer:**  
- Use Django’s `ugettext` or `gettext` functions in your code to mark strings for translation.  
- Set `LANGUAGE_CODE` and use `LocaleMiddleware`.  
- DRF responses will then return translated messages according to the user’s `Accept-Language` header or session settings.

### Q67. What are Signals in Django and how might they interact with your API?  
**Answer:**  
- Signals allow decoupled apps to receive notifications when certain events occur (e.g., `post_save` on a model).  
- In APIs, signals can trigger actions like sending notifications after a new user is created or invalidating caches after data changes.  
- Ensures business logic remains separated and modular.

### Q68. How do you implement partial updates using PATCH in DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- Use `partial=True` in the serializer’s `save()` method.  
- Implement `partial_update()` in your view or rely on DRF’s `UpdateModelMixin`.  
- This allows the client to submit only the fields that need updating.

### Q69. How can you utilize generic views effectively for CRUD operations in DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- Use `ListCreateAPIView` for listing and creating.  
- Use `RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView` for single-object retrieve, update, delete.  
- Override methods and perform custom logic as needed.  
- Significantly reduces boilerplate code and follows DRY principles.

### Q70. How do you integrate WebSockets or async functionality with a traditional DRF API?  
**Answer:**  
- DRF is synchronous by default.  
- For async, use Django Channels for WebSocket support.  
- Keep REST endpoints separate for standard CRUD and complement them with Channels for real-time communication.  
- Consider ASGI and async views if running on Django 3.1+.

## Documentation and Tooling

### Q71. How do you document a RESTful API built with DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- Use `drf-yasg` or `django-rest-swagger` to auto-generate OpenAPI (Swagger) docs.  
- Write docstrings in views and serializers to inform generated documentation.  
- Provide examples, request/response schemas, and authentication instructions.

### Q72. What tools (e.g., Swagger, drf-yasg) would you use for API documentation?  
**Answer:**  
- **drf-yasg:** Generates Swagger/OpenAPI documentation from DRF code.  
- **Redoc:** A cleaner UI for OpenAPI docs.  
- **Swagger UI:** Interactive interface to test endpoints directly from the browser.

### Q73. How do you keep documentation in sync with API code changes?  
**Answer:**  
- Use code-first documentation tools that generate docs from code (serializers, views).  
- Integrate doc generation into CI/CD pipelines.  
- Write tests that fail if documentation endpoints differ from the code’s declared schema.

### Q74. How would you implement a developer portal or interactive docs for your API?  
**Answer:**  
- Host Swagger UI or Redoc at a route like `/docs/`.  
- Include authentication and example credentials for testers.  
- Add guides, FAQs, and version notes.  
- Provide code samples in various languages.

### Q75. Explain how you would version documentation alongside your API versions.  
**Answer:**  
- Generate separate OpenAPI specs per API version (e.g., `/docs/v1/`, `/docs/v2/`).  
- Label each set of docs clearly.  
- Use a version selection dropdown in the UI so developers can pick the relevant docs.

### Q76. Have you used Postman/Insomnia for testing and documenting your API?  
**Answer:**  
- **Postman:** Useful for manually testing endpoints, saving requests, and exporting collections.  
- Can generate basic documentation and share collections with the team.  
- **Insomnia:** Similar to Postman, offers collections, environment variables, and request templates.

### Q77. How do you handle schema validation with OpenAPI/Swagger in DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- Generate OpenAPI schema via `drf-yasg` or `Spectacular`.  
- Add annotations or use `Serializer` field definitions to ensure correct schema generation.  
- Validate request/response payloads against the schema during testing or runtime if needed.

### Q78. How do you set up automated generation of API documentation?  
**Answer:**  
- Add tools like `drf-yasg` in `INSTALLED_APPS`.  
- Configure URL routes for schema views.  
- Run `manage.py generate_swagger` or similar commands in CI to export API docs as JSON/YAML.  
- Deploy the generated docs or host them dynamically at runtime.

### Q79. Can you explain how to make your API self-describing using hypermedia links?  
**Answer:**  
- Include URLs (links) in responses that point to related resources or actions.  
- This aligns with HATEOAS principles, guiding clients through available API endpoints.  
- Use serializers or custom logic to embed hyperlinks to related endpoints.

### Q80. How do you integrate CI/CD pipelines to run tests and linting on your API code?  
**Answer:**  
- Use CI tools (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) to run `pytest`, `flake8`, `black` on each commit.  
- Fail the pipeline if tests fail or code style checks fail.  
- Automate deployments if tests pass, ensuring stable and reliable delivery.

## Microservices and Architecture

### Q81. How do you integrate a DRF service into a microservices architecture?  
**Answer:**  
- Treat the DRF service as one microservice exposing REST endpoints.  
- Other services communicate with it over HTTP or asynchronous messaging.  
- Use a service registry or API gateway to route requests.  
- Keep services loosely coupled and clearly define contracts (OpenAPI specs).

### Q82. How do you handle communication and data exchange between multiple APIs?  
**Answer:**  
- Synchronous calls via REST endpoints.  
- Asynchronous communication using message brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).  
- Standardize data formats (JSON, Protobuf) and document endpoints.  
- Handle errors, retries, and circuit breakers for resilience.

### Q83. How would you implement load balancing and service discovery?  
**Answer:**  
- Use a load balancer like Nginx or an API gateway (e.g., Kong, Ambassador) in front of services.  
- Service discovery via Consul, Eureka, or Kubernetes built-in service discovery.  
- Ensure that new instances register/unregister seamlessly.

### Q84. How do you manage configuration for multiple environments in a microservices setup?  
**Answer:**  
- Use environment variables for settings (e.g., DB credentials, API keys).  
- Externalize configuration in tools like Consul, Vault, or config files managed by CI/CD.  
- Maintain separate configs for dev, stage, and prod environments.

### Q85. How do you ensure backward compatibility when multiple services depend on your API?  
**Answer:**  
- Implement versioning so older clients continue to use `v1` while newer clients use `v2`.  
- Deprecate endpoints gradually, providing a migration window.  
- Communicate changes clearly to other teams and maintain robust release notes.

### Q86. What patterns or tools do you use for distributed tracing and logging (e.g., OpenTelemetry)?  
**Answer:**  
- Integrate tracing middleware (e.g., `django-opentelemetry`) to propagate trace IDs.  
- Use a distributed tracing system (Jaeger, Zipkin) to visualize request flows across services.  
- Standardize logging formats (JSON logs) and use correlation IDs for debugging.

### Q87. Can you explain the circuit breaker pattern and when to use it?  
**Answer:**  
- The circuit breaker pattern detects failed calls to a service and temporarily “breaks” the circuit, returning errors immediately without trying the failing service.  
- It protects your system from cascading failures by preventing repeated slow or failing calls to unhealthy services.

### Q88. How would you handle asynchronous messaging between services?  
**Answer:**  
- Use message brokers like RabbitMQ, Kafka, or AWS SQS.  
- Publish events for service changes; other services subscribe and react asynchronously.  
- This decouples services and improves scalability and resilience.

### Q89. How do you secure communication between microservices (e.g., mutual TLS)?  
**Answer:**  
- Use TLS certificates for each service and enable mutual TLS verification.  
- Rotate certificates regularly.  
- Limit network access via firewalls, service mesh (Istio, Linkerd), or Zero Trust architectures.

### Q90. How do you handle transaction integrity across multiple microservices?  
**Answer:**  
- Use the Saga pattern or other distributed transaction patterns.  
- Implement compensating actions if a step in a multi-service workflow fails.  
- Avoid tightly coupled ACID transactions across services; rely on eventual consistency.

## API Monitoring, Logging, and Analytics

### Q91. How do you monitor the health and uptime of your REST API?  
**Answer:**  
- Implement health check endpoints (e.g., `/health/` returning system status).  
- Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or AWS CloudWatch to track uptime and response times.  
- Alert on failures or latency spikes.

### Q92. What metrics do you track (e.g., request latency, error rates) and why?  
**Answer:**  
- **Latency (response time):** Helps identify performance bottlenecks.  
- **Error rates (4xx/5xx):** Monitors stability and correctness.  
- **Throughput (requests per second):** Measures load handling.  
- **Apdex score:** Measures user satisfaction.  
- Tracking these helps proactively fix issues and plan capacity.

### Q93. How do you integrate logging frameworks like ELK stack or Splunk with DRF?  
**Answer:**  
- Use Python’s standard logging, route logs to a file or stdout.  
- Configure log forwarders (Filebeat, Fluentd) to send logs to ELK or Splunk.  
- Structure logs in JSON to facilitate search and analysis.

### Q94. How do you set up alerts for API failures or performance degradation?  
**Answer:**  
- Use monitoring tools (Prometheus + Alertmanager, Datadog, New Relic) to define thresholds (e.g., latency > 200ms, error rate > 5%).  
- Send alerts via email, Slack, PagerDuty.  
- Set up on-call rotations and escalation policies.

### Q95. How do you analyze API usage patterns and identify potential bottlenecks?  
**Answer:**  
- Review logs and metrics for frequent endpoints, their latency, and error patterns.  
- Use APM tools to trace requests and identify slow database queries or external calls.  
- Run load tests and analyze performance profiles.

### Q96. How do you handle distributed tracing in microservices-based APIs?  
**Answer:**  
- Use OpenTelemetry to instrument services with trace IDs and span IDs.  
- Propagate these IDs through HTTP headers so each service adds spans to the overall trace.  
- Visualize end-to-end requests in Jaeger or Zipkin.

### Q97. What strategies do you use for blue-green or canary deployments?  
**Answer:**  
- **Blue-Green:** Run two environments (blue and green) in parallel. Route traffic to green after successful tests, keep blue as a rollback option.  
- **Canary:** Gradually route a small percentage of traffic to the new version and monitor before increasing.  
- These strategies reduce deployment risk and downtime.

### Q98. How do you enforce or measure SLAs and SLOs for your API endpoints?  
**Answer:**  
- Define **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** (e.g., 99% requests under 300ms).  
- Measure real-time metrics against SLOs.  
- If metrics degrade, trigger alerts and investigate root causes.  
- SLAs are contractual obligations often measured over longer periods.

### Q99. How would you integrate feature flags or A/B testing into your API logic?  
**Answer:**  
- Use a feature flag service (e.g., LaunchDarkly, Unleash).  
- Check feature flags at runtime to enable or disable code paths.  
- Randomly assign clients to different feature sets (A/B testing) and measure outcomes.

### Q100. How do you ensure that your API adheres to compliance and regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)?  
**Answer:**  
- Implement strict data handling policies: encrypt sensitive data, minimize data retention.  
- Log access requests and maintain audit trails.  
- Provide endpoints to delete or anonymize user data.  
- Undergo regular compliance audits and follow legal guidelines for data protection.
