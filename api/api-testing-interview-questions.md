- Verify that actual output matches the expected result (e.g., response body validation).

#### **13. How do you test error handling in APIs?**
- Send invalid requests and check if:
  - `400` for bad input.
  - `404` for nonexistent resources.
  - `500` for server errors.

#### **14. What is a mock API, and when would you use one?**
- A mock API simulates real API behavior.
- Use it when the real API is unavailable or during isolated testing.

#### **15. How do you test the security of an API?**
- Test for:
  - SQL Injection, XSS.
  - Authentication and authorization flaws.
  - Encryption (HTTPS).

---

### **Advanced Testing**
#### **16. What is the role of API gateways?**
- Handle authentication, rate limiting, request routing, and monitoring for APIs.

#### **17. How do you handle rate limiting in APIs?**
- Send multiple requests rapidly and verify the server responds with `429 Too Many Requests`.

#### **18. What is the purpose of versioning in APIs?**
- Manage backward compatibility, allowing clients to use older API versions while supporting newer ones.

#### **19. How do you perform data validation in API testing?**
- Check if the API returns expected values, formats, and types.

#### **20. What is the role of environment variables in API testing?**
- Store configuration details (e.g., URLs, keys) for flexibility across different environments.

---

### **CI/CD and Automation**
#### **21. How do you handle API testing in CI/CD pipelines?**
- Automate API tests using Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD and trigger them after code deployments.

#### **22. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous APIs?**
- **Synchronous**: Blocks client until the server responds.
- **Asynchronous**: Allows the client to continue while the server processes in the background.

#### **23. How do you test APIs with different content types?**
- Test `Content-Type` headers (e.g., `application/json`, `application/xml`) and validate responses.

#### **24. What is the purpose of using Postman for API testing?**
- Send requests, validate responses, automate collections, and manage environments.

#### **25. How do you handle API testing for microservices?**
- Test each service individually and perform integration tests to validate communication between them.

---

### **Contract Testing and Load Testing**
#### **26. What is contract testing in API testing?**
- Verifies API responses conform to predefined schemas (e.g., OpenAPI specifications).

#### **27. How do you perform load testing on APIs?**
- Use tools like JMeter or Gatling to simulate concurrent users and monitor performance under load.

#### **28. What is the purpose of using API testing frameworks?**
- Provide structured testing with features like assertions, reporting, and automation.

#### **29. How do you handle pagination in API responses?**
- Test `next`/`previous` links and ensure data integrity across pages.

#### **30. What is the significance of the Accept header in API requests?**
- Specifies the response format (e.g., JSON, XML) the client expects.

---

### **Timeouts and Response Validation**
#### **31. How do you test APIs that require multiple steps to complete a transaction?**
- Test individual steps and validate intermediate states (e.g., user registration, email verification).

#### **32. What is the role of API documentation?**
- Helps developers understand endpoints, request formats, and responses.

- Measure response time using tools like Postman or JMeter and ensure it meets performance criteria.

#### **38. What are best practices for API testing?**
- Automate repetitive tests.
- Use environment variables.

- Use tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to detect SQL Injection, XSS, or authentication flaws.

#### **44. What is the difference between functional and non-functional testing of APIs?**
- Functional: Verifies intended functionality.
