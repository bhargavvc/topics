One crucial aspect we haven't discussed yet is how domain names like `google.com` are translated into IP addresses that computers use to route traffic. This process involves the **Domain Name System (DNS)**.

### **Domain Name System (DNS)**

The **Domain Name System** acts as the internet's phonebook. It translates human-friendly domain names into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. When you enter a URL like `https://www.example.com` into your browser, here's what happens:

1. **Local DNS Cache Check**: Your computer first checks its local cache to see if it has recently resolved this domain name. If found, it uses the cached IP address.

2. **Recursive DNS Resolver**: If not in the local cache, the request is sent to a recursive DNS resolver, often provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

3. **Root Name Server Query**: The resolver queries a root name server, which responds with the address of a Top-Level Domain (TLD) name server (e.g., for `.com`, `.net`).

4. **TLD Name Server Query**: The resolver then queries the TLD name server, which provides the address of the domain's authoritative name server.

5. **Authoritative Name Server Query**: Finally, the resolver queries the authoritative name server for `example.com`, which returns the IP address associated with `www.example.com`.

6. **Connection Established**: Your computer now knows the IP address and can establish a connection with the server.

### **DNS and System Design**

Understanding DNS is crucial in system design for several reasons:

- **Load Balancing**: DNS can distribute traffic among multiple servers by returning different IP addresses for the same domain name.

- **Redundancy and Failover**: DNS allows for redundancy by pointing to backup servers if the primary server fails.

- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: CDNs use DNS to direct users to the closest server geographically, reducing latency.

---

### **Caching and TTL**

DNS records have a **Time To Live (TTL)** value, which specifies how long a DNS record should be cached. A higher TTL reduces the number of DNS queries but slows down the propagation of changes. A lower TTL speeds up propagation but increases the number of queries.

### **Understanding Subnets and CIDR Notation**

**Subnetting** divides a network into smaller networks, improving routing efficiency and network management.

- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) Notation**: Represents IP addresses and their associated routing prefix. For example, `192.168.1.0/24` means the first 24 bits are the network part, and the last 8 bits are for host addresses.

### **Network Layers and the OSI Model**

Networking is organized into layers to standardize communication and troubleshoot issues effectively. The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model** is a conceptual framework with seven layers:

1. **Physical Layer**: Transmission of raw bit streams over a physical medium.

2. **Data Link Layer**: Node-to-node data transfer, error detection, and correction.

3. **Network Layer**: Routing of data packets between devices across different networks (IP operates here).

4. **Transport Layer**: End-to-end communication, reliability, and flow control (TCP and UDP operate here).

5. **Session Layer**: Managing sessions between applications.

6. **Presentation Layer**: Data translation, encryption, and decryption.

7. **Application Layer**: Network services to end-users (HTTP, FTP, SMTP).

In practice, the **TCP/IP model** simplifies these into four layers:

- **Application Layer**
- **Transport Layer**
- **Internet Layer**
- **Link Layer**

### **TCP vs. UDP**

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** and **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** are two core protocols at the transport layer.

#### **TCP**

- **Connection-oriented**: Establishes a connection before data transfer.
- **Reliable**: Ensures data is received in order and without errors.
- **Use Cases**: Web browsing, email, file transfers.

#### **UDP**

- **Connectionless**: Sends data without establishing a connection.
- **Unreliable**: No guarantee of order or delivery.
- **Faster**: Lower overhead makes it suitable for time-sensitive applications.
- **Use Cases**: Live streaming, online gaming, VoIP.

---

### **Firewalls and Network Security**

**Firewalls** are security devices (hardware or software) that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

- **Packet Filtering**: Inspects packets and blocks or allows them based on source/destination IP addresses and ports.
- **Stateful Inspection**: Tracks the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context.
- **Application Layer Firewalls**: Deep inspection of traffic at the application layer.

---

### **Network Address Translation (NAT)**

**NAT** allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address.

- **How NAT Works**: Modifies the IP addresses in the IP header of packets while in transit.
- **Types of NAT**:
  - **Static NAT**: One-to-one mapping between local and global addresses.
  - **Dynamic NAT**: Maps private IP addresses to a pool of public IP addresses.
  - **Port Address Translation (PAT)**: Maps multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address using different ports.

---

### **Load Balancing**

**Load balancers** distribute network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck.

#### **Types of Load Balancers**

- **Hardware Load Balancers**: Physical devices that distribute traffic.
- **Software Load Balancers**: Software applications running on standard hardware.

#### **Load Balancing Algorithms**

- **Round Robin**: Sequentially distributes requests.
- **Least Connections**: Sends new requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
- **IP Hash**: Determines which server to use based on client's IP address.

---

### **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**

CDNs are networks of distributed servers that deliver content to users based on their geographic location.

- **Benefits**:
  - **Reduced Latency**: Servers closer to users result in faster content delivery.
  - **Bandwidth Savings**: Offloads traffic from the origin server.
  - **Improved Availability**: Redundancy reduces downtime.

---

### **SSL/TLS and HTTPS**

**SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** and **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** are cryptographic protocols providing secure communication over a network.

- **HTTPS**: Secure version of HTTP using SSL/TLS.
- **Encryption**: Protects data from eavesdropping.
- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of the server.

---

### **WebSockets**

**WebSockets** provide full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

- **Use Cases**: Real-time applications like chat apps, live notifications.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Persistent Connection**: Reduces overhead of establishing connections.
  - **Bi-directional Communication**: Server can push data to the client without a request.

---

### **Application Layer Protocols**

Beyond HTTP and HTTPS, several other protocols operate at the application layer:

- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: For transferring files.
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: For sending emails.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: For translating domain names to IP addresses.
- **gRPC**: A high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework.
