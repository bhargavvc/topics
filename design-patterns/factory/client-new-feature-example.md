**Factory Method Pattern Illustrated with New Examples in Python**

Let's explore the Factory Method Pattern using Client examples:

1. **Feature Implementation Assignment**: A client requests a new feature, and the product manager assigns the appropriate developer to implement it. The client doesn't need to know who the developer is; they just receive the completed feature.
 
we'll see how the Factory Method Pattern abstracts the creation process, allowing clients to work with interfaces rather than concrete implementations.

### **Example 1: Feature Implementation Assignment**

**Scenario:**

- **Client**: Requests a new feature.
- **Product Manager**: Decides which developer is best suited for the feature.
- **Developers**: Different types (e.g., frontend, backend, full-stack) implement the feature.
- **Client**: Receives the completed feature without knowing who developed it.

**Applying the Factory Method Pattern:**

- **Product Interface**: `Feature`
- **Concrete Products**: `FrontendFeature`, `BackendFeature`, `FullStackFeature`
- **Creator (Factory)**: `ProductManager`
- **Concrete Creators**: `FrontendManager`, `BackendManager`, `FullStackManager`

**Implementation in Python:**

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Product Interface
class Feature(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def develop(self):
        pass

# Concrete Products
class FrontendFeature(Feature):
    def develop(self):
        return "Frontend Developer is implementing the feature."

class BackendFeature(Feature):
    def develop(self):
        return "Backend Developer is implementing the feature."

class FullStackFeature(Feature):
    def develop(self):
        return "Full-Stack Developer is implementing the feature."

# Creator (Factory) Interface
class ProductManager(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def assign_developer(self):
        pass

    def deliver_feature(self):
        feature = self.assign_developer()
        result = feature.develop()
        return result

# Concrete Creators
class FrontendManager(ProductManager):
    def assign_developer(self):
        return FrontendFeature()

class BackendManager(ProductManager):
    def assign_developer(self):
        return BackendFeature()

class FullStackManager(ProductManager):
    def assign_developer(self):
        return FullStackFeature()

# Client Code
def client_code(manager: ProductManager):
    print(manager.deliver_feature())

# Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Client requests a frontend feature:")
    client_code(FrontendManager())

    print("\nClient requests a backend feature:")
    client_code(BackendManager())

    print("\nClient requests a full-stack feature:")
    client_code(FullStackManager())
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Feature (Product Interface)**: An abstract base class defining the `develop` method.
   ```python
   class Feature(ABC):
       @abstractmethod
       def develop(self):
           pass
   ```
2. **Concrete Features (Products)**: `FrontendFeature`, `BackendFeature`, and `FullStackFeature` implement the `develop` method.
   ```python
   class FrontendFeature(Feature):
       def develop(self):
           return "Frontend Developer is implementing the feature."
   ```
3. **ProductManager (Creator)**: An abstract base class with the factory method `assign_developer` and a method `deliver_feature` that uses it.
   ```python
   class ProductManager(ABC):
       @abstractmethod
       def assign_developer(self):
           pass

       def deliver_feature(self):
           feature = self.assign_developer()
           result = feature.develop()
           return result
   ```
4. **Concrete Managers (Concrete Creators)**: `FrontendManager`, `BackendManager`, and `FullStackManager` implement `assign_developer`, returning the appropriate `Feature` instance.
   ```python
   class FrontendManager(ProductManager):
       def assign_developer(self):
           return FrontendFeature()
   ```
5. **Client Code**: The client interacts with the `ProductManager` interface, unaware of the concrete developer.
   ```python
   def client_code(manager: ProductManager):
       print(manager.deliver_feature())
   ```

**Output:**

```
Client requests a frontend feature:
Frontend Developer is implementing the feature.

Client requests a backend feature:
Backend Developer is implementing the feature.

Client requests a full-stack feature:
Full-Stack Developer is implementing the feature.
```

**Key Points:**

- **Abstraction**: The client requests a feature without knowing which developer implements it.
- **Factory Method**: `assign_developer` decides which concrete `Feature` to instantiate.
- **Loose Coupling**: The client depends on the `ProductManager` abstraction, not concrete classes.


This pattern is a powerful tool for designing systems where the exact types of objects to create are determined by subclasses.
