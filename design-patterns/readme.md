## Commonly Used Top 10 Patterns in Orderwise
Based on the image, the design patterns are ranked in terms of their common usage and frequency in practical software development:

### **Ranked Order of the Patterns**
1. **[Singleton Pattern](https://github.com/bhargavvc/topics/tree/main/design-patterns/singleton)**  
   - Most commonly used due to its simplicity and applicability in ensuring a single instance of an object across an application (e.g., logging, configuration, database connections).

2. **[Factory Pattern](https://github.com/bhargavvc/topics/tree/main/design-patterns/factory)**  
   - Widely used to manage object creation without exposing the instantiation logic, making code more scalable and maintainable.

3. **[Observer Pattern](https://github.com/bhargavvc/topics/tree/main/design-patterns/observer)**  
   - Extremely useful in systems where state changes need to notify multiple objects, such as event-driven architectures or real-time applications.

4. **[Strategy Pattern](https://github.com/bhargavvc/topics/tree/main/design-patterns/strategy)**  
   - Frequently used for dynamically choosing behaviors or algorithms at runtime (e.g., different payment gateways, sorting algorithms).

5. **[Builder Pattern](https://github.com/bhargavvc/topics/tree/main/design-patterns/builder)**  
   - Handy for constructing complex objects step by step, especially in cases with many optional parameters (e.g., creating complex UI elements or assembling configurations).

6. **[Decorator Pattern](https://github.com/bhargavvc/topics/tree/main/design-patterns/decorator)**  
   - Commonly used when you need to extend or modify the behavior of objects dynamically, especially in GUI frameworks or middleware systems.

7. **[Adapter Pattern](https://github.com/bhargavvc/topics/tree/main/design-patterns/adapter)**  
   - Often used in system integration to bridge incompatible interfaces, making it essential in legacy or third-party system integration scenarios.

8. **[Facade Pattern](https://github.com/bhargavvc/topics/tree/main/design-patterns/facade)**  
   - Commonly applied in complex systems to provide a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as APIs or subsystems.

### **Explanation of Ranking**
The **Singleton**, **Factory**, and **Observer** patterns take the top spots because of their frequent applicability in real-world projects. Patterns like **Builder** and **Strategy** are situational but widely used for specific needs, while **Adapter** and **Facade** are essential in integration-heavy systems but less commonly needed in simpler projects.
