 
## **Commonly Used Top 10 Patterns in Orderwise**

Based on the image, the design patterns are ranked in terms of their **common usage in real-world applications**.
 
### **Ranked Order of the Patterns**

1. **[Singleton Pattern](https://github.com/bhargavvc/topics/tree/main/design-patterns/singleton)**  
   - **Usage**: Global configurations, database connections, caching, logging.  
   - **Why Important**: Ensures one instance of a class is created, controlling access to shared resources.

2. **[Factory Pattern](https://github.com/bhargavvc/topics/tree/main/design-patterns/factory)**  
   - **Usage**: Dependency Injection frameworks (e.g., Spring), dynamic object creation in frameworks or APIs.  
   - **Why Important**: Decouples object creation logic, improving scalability and flexibility.

3. **[Observer Pattern](https://github.com/bhargavvc/topics/tree/main/design-patterns/observer)**  
   - **Usage**: Event-driven systems like real-time notifications, messaging queues, and UI listeners.  
   - **Why Important**: Efficiently manages dependencies by notifying subscribers of state changes.

4. **[Strategy Pattern](https://github.com/bhargavvc/topics/tree/main/design-patterns/strategy)**  
   - **Usage**: Implementing algorithms or business rules that vary at runtime (e.g., payment gateways, tax calculations).  
   - **Why Important**: Promotes open-closed principle by encapsulating interchangeable algorithms.

5. **[Builder Pattern](https://github.com/bhargavvc/topics/tree/main/design-patterns/builder)**  
   - **Usage**: Creating complex objects step-by-step like configurations, documents, and UI elements.  
   - **Why Important**: Helps manage the construction of objects with multiple optional components.

6. **[Decorator Pattern](https://github.com/bhargavvc/topics/tree/main/design-patterns/decorator)**  
   - **Usage**: Extending behavior dynamically, such as adding features to GUI components or middleware in web frameworks.  
   - **Why Important**: Provides an alternative to subclassing by dynamically extending an objectâ€™s functionality.

7. **[Adapter Pattern](https://github.com/bhargavvc/topics/tree/main/design-patterns/adapter)**  
   - **Usage**: Bridging incompatible interfaces, such as integrating legacy systems or third-party libraries.  
   - **Why Important**: Acts as a translator to enable compatibility between different systems.

8. **[Facade Pattern](https://github.com/bhargavvc/topics/tree/main/design-patterns/facade)**  
   - **Usage**: Simplifying interactions with complex systems, such as providing a unified API for microservices.  
   - **Why Important**: Hides complexities and provides a simpler interface to clients.
