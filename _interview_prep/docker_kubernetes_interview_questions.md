# Docker and Kubernetes Interview Questions and Answers

### **6. Docker and Kubernetes**

51. **What is Docker, and why is it used?**
   - Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. It allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into containers, ensuring that they run consistently across different environments. Docker is used for its portability, efficiency, and ease of use in managing application lifecycles.

52. **Explain the concept of containerization.**
   - Containerization is a lightweight form of virtualization that allows applications to run in isolated environments called containers. Each container shares the host operating system's kernel but operates independently, with its own filesystem, libraries, and dependencies. This ensures that applications run consistently regardless of the environment, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications.

53. **How do you create a Dockerfile? Provide an example.**
   - A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image, application code, dependencies, and commands to run the application. 
   **Example**:
   ```dockerfile
   # Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
   FROM python:3.9

   # Set the working directory
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy the requirements file
   COPY requirements.txt .

   # Install the dependencies
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   # Copy the application code
   COPY . .

   # Expose the application port
   EXPOSE 8000

   # Command to run the application
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```

54. **How do you expose a FastAPI application via Docker?**
   - To expose a FastAPI application via Docker, you need to specify the port on which the FastAPI application is running in the Dockerfile using the `EXPOSE` instruction. Additionally, when running the Docker container, you can map the container port to a host port using the `-p` option.
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 my_fastapi_image
   ```

55. **What are Docker volumes, and how do they work?**
   - Docker volumes are a way to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. They are stored outside the container's filesystem and can be shared between containers. Volumes allow data to persist even when containers are stopped or removed, making them ideal for databases and other applications that require data storage.

56. **What is Kubernetes, and how does it manage containers?**
   - Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It manages containers by grouping them into logical units called Pods, which can be deployed, scaled, and managed as a single entity. Kubernetes provides features like load balancing, service discovery, and automated rollouts and rollbacks.

57. **What is the role of a Pod in Kubernetes?**
   - A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, representing a single instance of a running process in a cluster. A Pod can contain one or more containers that share the same network namespace and storage volumes. Pods are used to manage and scale applications, and they can be scheduled on any node in the cluster.

58. **Explain the difference between a Kubernetes Deployment and a StatefulSet.**
   - **Deployment**: A Deployment is used to manage stateless applications. It ensures that a specified number of replicas of a Pod are running at all times and provides features like rolling updates and rollbacks.
   - **StatefulSet**: A StatefulSet is used to manage stateful applications. It provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of Pods, making it suitable for applications that require stable network identities and persistent storage, such as databases.

59. **How do you scale a FastAPI application using Kubernetes?**
   - To scale a FastAPI application in Kubernetes, you can update the number of replicas in the Deployment configuration. This can be done using the `kubectl scale` command:
   ```bash
   kubectl scale deployment my-fastapi-deployment --replicas=5
   ```

60. **How do you secure a containerized application?**
   - Securing a containerized application can be achieved through several practices:
     - **Use minimal base images**: Start with minimal images to reduce the attack surface.
     - **Implement network policies**: Control traffic between Pods using Kubernetes network policies.
     - **Use secrets management**: Store sensitive information like passwords and API keys securely using Kubernetes Secrets.
     - **Regularly update images**: Keep images up to date with the latest security patches.
     - **Scan images for vulnerabilities**: Use tools to scan Docker images for known vulnerabilities before deployment.
