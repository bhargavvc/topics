  - Open-source project that brings reliability and performance to data lakes.
  - Adds ACID transactions to data lakes.

### **Use Cases**:
- Storing raw data for analytics and machine learning.
- Handling diverse data formats (e.g., JSON, CSV, images, logs).

---

## **5. Stream Processing**
**Definition**: Real-time processing of data as it is produced, enabling low-latency analytics and decision-making.

### **Key Tools**:
- **Apache Kafka**:
  - Distributed event-streaming platform widely used for real-time data ingestion.
- **Apache Flink**:
  - Scalable stream-processing framework with advanced state management.
- **Amazon Kinesis**:
  - Managed service for collecting and processing real-time streaming data.

### **Use Cases**:
- Monitoring application logs and metrics in real-time.
- Fraud detection systems that require instant decisions.

---

## **6. Data Warehousing**
**Definition**: Centralized repository for storing and managing structured data for reporting and analytics.

### **Key Tools**:
- **Snowflake**:
  - Cloud-native data warehouse offering elastic scalability and performance.
- **BigQuery**:
  - Google’s serverless, highly scalable data warehouse.
- **Redshift**:
  - AWS’s fully managed data warehouse optimized for large-scale data queries.

### **Use Cases**:
- Business intelligence and dashboarding (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).
- Running complex analytical queries on historical data.

---

## **7. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Tools**
**Definition**: Tools used to extract data from various sources, transform it for analysis, and load it into a destination (e.g., a data warehouse).

### **Key Tools**:
- **Apache Nifi**:
  - Data integration tool for automating the flow of data between systems.
- **Informatica**:
  - Enterprise-grade data integration platform with extensive transformation capabilities.
- **Talend**:
  - Open-source ETL tool for building and deploying data pipelines.

### **Use Cases**:
- Cleaning and normalizing raw data for analytics.
- Consolidating data from multiple systems into a single repository.

---

## **8. Data Pipelines**
**Definition**: Automated workflows that move data from source systems to storage or analytical systems.

### **Key Tools**:
- **Apache Airflow**:
  - Workflow orchestration tool for building, scheduling, and monitoring data pipelines.
- **Luigi**:
  - Python-based tool for building long-running batch processing pipelines.
- **Dagster**:
  - Modern orchestration tool that focuses on data-driven pipelines and observability.

### **Use Cases**:
- Orchestrating daily data ingestion workflows.
- Managing dependencies in large-scale ETL pipelines.
