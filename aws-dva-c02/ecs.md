### **Overview**

**Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)** is a fully managed container orchestration service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances or using AWS Fargate without the need to install and operate your own container orchestration software. Amazon ECS simplifies running containers in a production environment by handling the complexity of cluster management, scheduling, and scaling.
