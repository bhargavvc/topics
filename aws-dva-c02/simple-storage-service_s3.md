    - SSE-KMS: AWS Key Management Service manages keys.
    - SSE-C: You provide and manage encryption keys.
  - **Client-Side Encryption:**
    - Data is encrypted before being sent to S3.

#### **4. Storage Classes and Lifecycle Management**

- **Storage Classes:**
  - Choose based on access patterns and cost requirements.

- **Lifecycle Policies:**
  - Automate transitioning objects between storage classes.
  - Define rules to expire objects after a certain period.

#### **5. Versioning and Object Lock**

- **Versioning:**
  - Keep multiple versions of an object to protect against accidental deletion or overwrites.

- **Object Lock:**
  - Enforce retention policies for regulatory compliance.

#### **6. Data Transfer Options**

- **Multipart Upload:**
  - Efficiently upload large objects in parts.

- **S3 Transfer Acceleration:**
  - Uses AWS Edge Locations to accelerate uploads and downloads.

- **AWS Snow Family:**
  - Physical devices for petabyte-scale data transfer.

#### **7. Event Notifications**

- **Integration with AWS Lambda:**
  - Automatically trigger functions in response to S3 events.

- **Amazon SQS and SNS:**
  - Send notifications when specific events occur in your bucket.

#### **8. Data Processing**

- **S3 Select and Glacier Select:**
  - Retrieve subsets of data from within an object using SQL expressions, reducing the amount of data transferred.
