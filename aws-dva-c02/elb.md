Certainly! Let's explore **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** in detail.

---

### **Overview**

**Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** is a fully managed load balancing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions. ELB enhances the fault tolerance and availability of your applications by ensuring that no single resource becomes a bottleneck. It scales your load balancer capacity automatically in response to changes in incoming traffic.

   - **Application Load Balancer (ALB):**
     - Operates at the application layer (OSI model Layer 7).
     - Ideal for HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
     - Supports advanced request routing based on URL, host, headers, and query string.
     - Integrates with AWS services like AWS WAF and AWS Lambda.

   - **Network Load Balancer (NLB):**
     - Operates at the transport layer (OSI model Layer 4).
     - Handles millions of requests per second with ultra-low latency.
     - Suitable for TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic.
     - Provides static IP addresses and supports Elastic IPs.

   - **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB):**
     - Operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer).
     - Simplifies deployment and scaling of virtual appliances like firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
     - Combines transparent network gateway and load balancing capabilities.
