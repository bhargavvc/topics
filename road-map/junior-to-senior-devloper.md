### 3. API Development
**Overview:** APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) define how software components interact. Effective API design and development ensure scalable, maintainable services and robust communication between clients and servers.

- **REST APIs:** Representational State Transfer is the most common style of web APIs. They use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), stateless requests, and JSON/XML for communication. REST principles ensure scalable, reliable interfaces.
  
- **gRPC:** A high-performance, open-source RPC framework using Protocol Buffers. gRPC is language-agnostic, efficient, and well-suited for microservices and internal service communication due to its binary serialization and streaming capabilities.

### 5. Databases
**Overview:** Databases store, retrieve, and manage data. Understanding different database types, query languages, and performance considerations is key to building reliable applications.

- **Relational Databases:** Structured data storage using tables with defined schemas. SQL (Structured Query Language) is used for querying. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server. They ensure data integrity, ACID transactions, and a rich query model.
  
- **Non-Relational (NoSQL) Databases:** Designed for unstructured or semi-structured data and horizontal scaling. Examples include MongoDB (document store), Cassandra (wide-column), and Redis (in-memory key-value). Suitable for flexible schemas, rapid scaling, and high-volume read/write workloads.

### 6. Authentication & Testing
**Overview:** Authentication secures your application by ensuring only authorized users can access resources. Testing ensures that your code is correct, reliable, and maintainable.

- **Tokens:** A piece of data (like a session token) passed between client and server to maintain authenticated sessions. Often stored as cookies or in local storage.
  
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** A stateless method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. Common in single-page applications to verify user identity without maintaining server-side sessions.
  
- **OAuth 2.0:** An industry-standard protocol for authorization. It allows third-party applications to obtain limited access to HTTP services without exposing user credentials.
  
- **Cookies:** Small pieces of data stored in the browser. Frequently used for sessions, preferences, and keeping users logged in.
  
- **TDD (Test-Driven Development):** A software development approach where tests are written before the code. Red-Green-Refactor cycle ensures code correctness and maintainability.
  
- **Unit Tests:** Tests that verify the functionality of the smallest units of code (functions, methods) in isolation.
  
- **E2E Tests (End-to-End Tests):** Tests that verify the workflow of the entire application from start to finish, simulating real user scenarios.
  
- **Performance Testing:** Evaluating how well the system performs under expected workloads (response times, throughput, resource usage). Tools and metrics help ensure the application can scale and remain responsive.

### 8. CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)
**Overview:** CI/CD automates the process of building, testing, and deploying software. It accelerates release cycles, reduces integration problems, and ensures that code is always production-ready.

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Merging code changes frequently, running automated tests, and catching issues early. Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or GitLab CI automate builds and tests whenever code is pushed.
  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Extends CI by automatically deploying changes to production once tests pass. Reduces manual intervention, ensures quick feedback, and supports rapid iteration.

### 9. Design Patterns
**Overview:** Design patterns provide time-tested solutions to common software design problems. They help create more maintainable, reusable, and understandable codebases.

- **Factory Pattern:** Creates objects without specifying the exact class to instantiate. Centralizes object creation logic.
  
- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Decouples components by injecting dependencies rather than hardcoding them. Facilitates testing and modularity.
  
- **Proxy:** Controls access to another object, adding a layer of indirection. Useful for lazy loading, access control, and logging.
  
- **Observer:** Allows objects to subscribe to events and get notified when a state changes. Useful in event-driven systems, GUIs, and real-time notifications.
  
- **Facade:** Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. Makes a library or codebase easier to use by hiding internal complexity.
