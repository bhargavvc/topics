## Introduction
Ricky went from Junior (IC3) to Staff (IC6) at Google by 28. He started there as a new grad with a total compensation of $180K, which grew to $520K within a few years.

I interviewed him to learn more since he got promoted fast even though Google is known for slower promotions.

In our conversation, Ricky said he wasn’t the best engineer but had a good blend of technical and soft skills that helped him get promoted fast. A few things I found interesting:

- **He wishes he grew slower** - Ricky is the first person to tell me that he wishes Staff career growth opportunities came later. His increased responsibility made his work schedule much less flexible.
- **Saying no to projects** - He turned down projects assigned by his manager if he could find something more impactful. He always presented a well-thought-out alternative.
- **Staying within the same team** - He stayed on the same team for 6 years since he felt his management chain was supportive and he had good growth opportunities.
- **Imposter syndrome** - He felt like a “personality hire” and was uncertain about his performance despite positive feedback. He overcame it when he learned that most Googlers also feel some and had some successful projects under his belt.

## Promotion Timelines and Compensation

### Junior to Mid-Level Promotion (L3 to L4)
**Timeline:** Promoted in 1.5 years  
**Compensation:** $180K → $250K

**Summary:**  
This promotion was straightforward. He had a lot of imposter syndrome but forced himself to ask questions anyway despite worrying about looking “dumb.”

This is where he started to build the fundamental hard skills he needed to succeed. He focused on working independently and finishing projects without hand-holding. This is typical for this first promotion.

His soft skills were good from the beginning. He mentioned he was managing expectations with his manager and making sure what he was doing was aligned with promotion.

### Mid-Level to Senior Promotion (L4 to L5)
**Timeline:** Promoted in 1.5 years  
**Compensation:** $250K → $350K

**Summary:**  
He got promoted quickly at this level because of a few key takeaways:

- **Took ownership of an area** - One of the areas on his team didn’t have a clear owner. He became the “go-to person” for that area, which gave him opportunities to lead and have more impact.
- **Planning his promotion out** - He found impactful projects that fit the next level’s behaviors. Part of this was learning to say no to work that wasn’t at the next level or helping him grow.
- **Managed up** - He put together a roadmap of projects that he believed would be impactful and get him promoted. Then, he checked with his manager to get buy-in. After that, it was just a matter of execution.

### Senior to Staff Promotion (L5 to L6)
**Timeline:** Promoted in 3 years  
**Compensation:** $350K → $520K

**Summary:**  
At this point, Ricky was an established leader in his org since he had stayed on the same team for years. He used this momentum to expand his influence behind his current team. He started to push the boundaries of what nearby teams were doing and challenge the status quo. This strong influence and leadership helped him have more leverage. This is what drove his promotion to the Staff level.

**Interesting Point:**  
A lot of what he did depended on the trust and influence he had. By staying at the same company for so long, he had a much easier time with this. This contrasts the common advice to job hop all the time. As always, it depends.

## Becoming a Manager
He learned quickly as a Senior engineer that he enjoyed mentoring others and seeing them grow. Becoming a manager was a natural step for him since he was already helping manage a sudden influx of 20 new hires. But transitioning so early led to some growing pains.

- **Awkward Interactions:** He felt awkward interacting with much older colleagues or running into reports outside of work.
- **Giving Critical Feedback:** Providing constructive criticism was tougher than when he was an IC.
- **Heavy Meeting Load:** The increased number of meetings added to his stress.

He said he wished the opportunity to become a manager came later, as it added stress in his early twenties when he felt like he should have had more flexibility.

## Reflections on His Career

### Imposter Syndrome
- **Early Doubts:** Early on, he doubted his skills and worried he was a “personality hire.”
- **Gaining Confidence:** He gained confidence after his projects succeeded.

### Luck vs. Skill
- **Balanced View:** He believes his success was 50% luck (stable team, good manager) and 50% preparation (working both diligently and strategically).
- **Readiness:** He emphasized how important it is to be ready when opportunities come up.

### Why He Stayed at Google
- **Regular Check-Ins:** He checked every 3-6 months on if he’d rather be working somewhere else.
- **Reasons to Stay:** He stayed since he enjoyed his team, found career growth opportunities, and appreciated the stability.

### Advice to His Younger Self
- **Self-Trust:** Trust yourself more and act on ideas sooner.
- **Overcoming Self-Doubt:** He felt he spent too much time second-guessing himself early in his career.
