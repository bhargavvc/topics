Q: Here is a Queue. But for me the Time stamp differece between the multiple message matter when consuming  by the worker. And it matters in a way that 
the service the put message into the  broker .that service may introduce duplcate message like let say nano seconds time stamp difference  how do u handle at the worker- level.
because u r supposed to process only once.

randomly service sends the duplicated nano..

there is service its sending random duplicated message(inserting into the broker) with nano seconds time stamp difference. how do u handle at the worker level.

we have control at broker and worker level

worker cant have read access its only have insert access
