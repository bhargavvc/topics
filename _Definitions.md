**Throughput**
   - **Concept**:  Throughput is a measure of the rate at which a system processes transactions or data units over a defined period,expressed in transactions per second (TPS), requests per second (RPS), or bytes per second (BPS)

   - **Advantage**: High throughput allows a system to handle more transactions and serve more users effectively.
   - **Disadvantage**: May require more powerful hardware or complex system configurations to handle high levels of data processing, impacting costs.
   - **Real-World Example**: High Request traffic websites like Netflix or YouTube that manage data streaming and user requests at massive scales to ensure smooth video playback and responsive user interfaces.

**Latency**
   - **Concept**: The time it takes for data to travel from one point in the network to another; crucial in networking and real-time processing.
   - **Advantage**: Low latency improves user experience by providing faster responses and real-time interaction capabilities.
   - **Disadvantage**: Achieving low latency across global systems can be challenging due to physical limitations(distance, infrastructure, and the inherent properties of data transmission), often requiring significant investment in optimized network solutions.
   - **Real-World Example**: Online gaming and stock trading platforms depend on real-time responsiveness, making low latency critical for user success and satisfaction.
